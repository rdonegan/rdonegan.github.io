                            <p><strong>My Role.</strong>  I collaborated as a designer on a team of six. I was responsible for planning many of the key features of the app experience, as well as determining new interactions and add ons.

                    <h4>BRAINSTORMING &amp; IDEA VALIDATION</h4>
                    <p>FitMate was conceived on the basis of two broad hypotheses: <i>many people like to exercise</i> + <i>many people would like to exercise with others</i>. To test our hypotheses, each member of the team created a short storyboard. Originally, we envisioned FitMate as appealing to people’s desire to stay healthy and get in shape. We tested this by creating five separate user scenarios and storyboards and asking potential users to walk through them in a ‘speed-dating’ format.</p>

                    <p>We found that people generally prefer working out with others if given the option and that <i>specific forms of exercise appeal to group workouts more than others</i>. Most respondents reported that they were <i>more inclined to workout with people in their community</i> (friends, classmates, coworkers, etc).</p>

                    <p>We found that we needed to <i>narrow our focus from all exercises to running</i> - an activity frequently performed in groups. We also pivoted to focus on matching people in <i>similar social groups</i> based on availability. To test FitMate’s appeal to younger audiences, we planned to test a model of FitMate that incorporated <i>gamification</i>, allowing users to challenge their friends to races.</p>

                    <h4>SKETCH TO WIREFRAME</h4>
                    <p>I modeled initial concepts after riders’ desires for cost and convenience. Our mobile solution - dubbed iCommute - aimed to consolidate transportation comparisons in one application.</p>

                    <h4>USER TESTING</h4>
                    <p>Initial user feedback to our wireframes supported the simplistic, one-screen nature of the application. Made for commuters on-the-go, convenience and accessibility were important.</p>

                    <p>Some users felt the app might have been too minimalist for first time users, relying on iconography mainly to support user activity. The app itself, we found to be too Uber-Lyft centric. Transportation encompasses many different forms, and we wanted our application to highlight these options. Rather than tell users what was best, we aimed to inform clearly and concisely so commuters could make quick decisions.</p>

                    <p>Part of our redesign involved creating a consistent, identifiable logo conveying a sense of simplicity and the passage of time. My first pass at logo creation, I worked through some attempts in Illustrator.</p>

                    <p>I tried to choose a color scheme that I thought would be both playful and trustworthy. I also didn't want to reflect color schemes of other popular ridesharing apps, Uber & Lyft. The palette is intentionally limited to allow user's to focus on quickly adding a destination and comparing transporation services.</p>

                    <h4>UI REVISIONS</h4>

                            <p>Our research also showed that users preferred a visual confirmation of input destinations when putting in an address. We addressed this by including a map on the home screen, similar to other ridesharing applications. The new home screen includes an additional visual aid that instructs users to enter where they want to go.</p>

                            <p>The “compare” screen no longer emphasizes a result beyond order of results, giving autonomy back to users. By tapping “Commute Details”, we hoped to offer more granularity to users who wish to know more about a service before committing. Users can now prioritize results by features such as cost and total trip time - accessible via the settings menu.</p>

                    <p>In the future, we would’ve liked to investigate the results page in order to determine what information is most important to users, in what situations, and how best to present it. </p>

                    <p>While the goal of the project itself was to produce a concept, we considered technical feasibility as well. Going forward, we would have liked to build a prototype based on available ridesharing API’s and publicly-accessible data.</p>
