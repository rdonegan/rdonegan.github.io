                    <h4>BACKGROUND RESEARCH</h4>
                    <p>Our team targeted transportation due to its recent popularity and growth. We conducted surveys to identify market gaps and opportunities. Evidently, <i>ridesharing</i> was a big topic of conversation. When we asked riders what mattered most to them, <i>cost and convenience dominated</i>. But when asked which ridesharing service they preferred, riders’ answers varied across the board.</p>

                    <p>We found that access to ride cost estimates varied by app. This inconvenienced riders who primarily relied on cost as a deciding factor in choosing between ridesharing experiences they felt were comparable.</p>

            <div class="row">

                    <h4>SKETCH TO WIREFRAME</h4>
                    <p>I modeled initial concepts after riders’ desires for cost and convenience. Our mobile solution - dubbed iCommute - aimed to consolidate transportation comparisons in one application.</p>

                    <h4>USER TESTING</h4>
                    <p>Initial user feedback to our wireframes supported the simplistic, one-screen nature of the application. Made for commuters on-the-go, convenience and accessibility were important.</p>

                    <p>Some users felt the app might have been too minimalist for first time users, relying on iconography mainly to support user activity. The app itself, we found to be too Uber-Lyft centric. Transportation encompasses many different forms, and we wanted our application to highlight these options. Rather than tell users what was best, we aimed to inform clearly and concisely so commuters could make quick decisions.</p>

                    <p>Part of our redesign involved creating a consistent, identifiable logo conveying a sense of simplicity and the passage of time. My first pass at logo creation, I worked through some attempts in Illustrator.</p>

                    <h4>COLOR MATTERS</h4>
                    <p>I tried to choose a color scheme that I thought would be both playful and trustworthy. I also didn't want to reflect color schemes of other popular ridesharing apps, Uber & Lyft. The palette is intentionally limited to allow user's to focus on quickly adding a destination and comparing transporation services.</p>

                    <h4>UI REVISIONS</h4>

                            <p>Our research also showed that users preferred a visual confirmation of input destinations when putting in an address. We addressed this by including a map on the home screen, similar to other ridesharing applications. The new home screen includes an additional visual aid that instructs users to enter where they want to go.</p>

                            <p>The “compare” screen no longer emphasizes a result beyond order of results, giving autonomy back to users. By tapping “Commute Details”, we hoped to offer more granularity to users who wish to know more about a service before committing. Users can now prioritize results by features such as cost and total trip time - accessible via the settings menu.</p>

                    <p>In the future, we would’ve liked to investigate the results page in order to determine what information is most important to users, in what situations, and how best to present it. </p>

                    <p>While the goal of the project itself was to produce a concept, we considered technical feasibility as well. Going forward, we would have liked to build a prototype based on available ridesharing API’s and publicly-accessible data.</p>
