                    <h4>OVERVIEW</h4>
                        
                         <p>To practice information architecture wokr in a mobile setting, I took a stab at redesigning SugarWOD, the Crossfit workout app. SugarWOD appeals to a niche audience of users who want to track the Workout of the Day (WOD) at their Crossfit affiliate. Unlike other fitness apps, SugarWOD is not so much about building a routine as it is connecting with your gym. That being said, SugarWOD contains a wealth of secondary features such as a social newsfeed, personal record tracking (PR’s), and WOD archive.</p>

                         <p>At the end of my process, I'd produced early concepts for a reimagined navigation and flow for SugarWOD, with some early stabs at visual updates.</p>

                    <h4>MODELING THE WORKFLOW</h4>
                    <p>As a frequent user of the app, I found it helpful to step back and examine SugarWOD by use case. I started by interviewing 5 users from my gym, as well as scouring some reviews on the app store for reference. I used my interviews and research as a baseline for identifying common pain points and criteria for me to focus my work. </p>

                    <p>I consistently found that users desired simplicity and relevance. Users appreciated the ability of the app to report the day’s workout, but were hesitant to branch out to other potentially useful functionality. I aimed to preserve this simplicity while reducing the barrier of entry to other useful app content.</p>

                    <h4>MARKET RESEARCH</h4>
                    <p>I looked to other fitness apps for inspiration. I found it useful to compare apps directly relevant to Crossfit vs. those that met other fitness needs. I found that simplistic navigation schemas created far superior apps, and that all-encompassing fitness apps were generally less successful than more focused apps. Clear CTA’s and delightful imagery were two areas I also identified as potential wins.</p>

                    <h4>PRIORITIZING USE CASES</h4>
                    <p>Rather than address all functional pain points, I prioritized high-level goals that would narrow my focus:</p>

                    <ul>
                    <li>Simplify navigation</li>

                    <li>Prioritize results and progress</li>

                    <li>Integrate stats into workouts</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p>I used Sketch to take ideas quickly from paper concept to digital. I tested a variety of iterations before landing on a direction I felt was appropriate.</p>

                    <p>Mapping user flows and auditing the pages of the app revealed a flawed information architecture. For instance, the navigation tabs - Whiteboard, Friends, Me, Notifications, More -  were ambiguous. As result, most users rarely left the Whiteboard tab. </p>

                    In an attempt to simplify, I did away with the bottom navigation. I achieved this by combining similar themes onto single screens (e.g. combining social elements of “Me”, “Friends”, and “Notifications”), and introducing a settings slide-out menu. I also chose to focus on the top use cases as identified through user research (WODs, entering scores, viewing benchmarks).

                    <p>In the prior design, individual stats for workouts were hidden under the “Me” tab. This ambiguous labeling hampered discoverability.

                        In this case, I integrated relevant movement statistics based on the daily workout requirements. Now, relevant skills and lift advice are surfaced on the home screen. Because this information is supplemental, it’s listed after the daily workout. Tapping into a section provides further details on progress on a movement over time - a user case built more for power users.

                    <p>Some of the more novice Crossfit-ers in my research noted the “jargon” used throughout SugarWOD and the Crossfit community. To somewhat address this, I played with introducing iconography. I hoped a visual identifier with some of the more foreign lift names would be useful and improve the friendliness of the app overall. I only attempted this for four lifts, knowing many more would need to be represented in the future.</p>

                    <p>The redesign almost exclusively focuses on issues of navigation. I chose to avoid some of the more auxiliary features of the app such as social media, though I left room for these enhancements. In addition, I took a stab at a new color palette, theme, and early icons - all of which would have to be reworked if I moved further with this project.</p>
