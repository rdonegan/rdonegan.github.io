                    <p>Prosper was the first company in the US to allow peer-to-peer lending and borrowing. In August 2019, Prosper launched Prosper Invest to allow allow investors to manage and add to their portfolios on-the-go.</p>

                    <p>As investors browsed options, <b>I observed that yield is the first "gate" investors need to pass to determine if a loan is worth their investment.</b></p>

                    <p>Next, some investors sought details on the borrower and financial history associated with each loan. For this reason, I knew it was important to prioritize information affecting the viability of an investment - yield and investment grade - while giving a clear pathway to all the granular details.</p>

                    <p>I explored both layout and content. Visually, I grappled with the ability to show more listings on the screen vs. easier comparison. Eventually, I opted for a single column card layout. This allowed users to more easily scan and compare listings.</p>

                    <p>Usage date from our web platform showed that roughly <b>30% of investors never look beyond the summary for each investment</b>. The other 70% review each investment in detail before deciding to invest. I dubbed these personas Scanners and Power-Shoppers, respectively.</p>

                    <p>Scanners are primarily motivated by diversification, and rely mainly on the grade and yield of each option to invest. Power-shoppers on the other hand are particularly risk averse, and truly want to understand the likelihood a loan will be paid back at a more granular level.</p>

                    <p><b>My goal was to support Scanners who select many investments at once, while enabling Power-Shoppers to dive in for details on a loan and borrower.</b></p>

                    <h4>FILTER AND SORT</h4>
                    <p>I observed that investors used a small, specific set of filters to narrow down their search. <b>I advocated for simplicity over complexity, and advocated we limit filters to the top used.</b> Based on data, we ended up simplifying from 30+ filter and sort options to just 12 on mobile.</p>

                    <p>Because Prosper Invest has an established design system, <b>my goal was to visually evoke themes of simplicity, clarity, and delight.</b> The UI is whitespace dominant with the exception of a light gray used on the (potentially long) list of investments. Blue is used to evoke attention and action, and the blue circle visual is carried through each loan listing. Upon a successful purchase, colorful confetti falls from the top of the screen.</p>

                    <h4>HOW MOBILE HELPED: A POST MORTEM</h4>
                    <p>Mobile isn’t a perfect medium, but in this case, it actually provided some noteworthy benefits:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Strict Info Hierarchy.</b> Early discovery suggested that information overload is a huge deterrent for new and even intermediate investors. Limited mobile real estate reinforced the need to prioritize only the most critical information.</li>
                        <li><b>Familiar Patterns.</b> Mobile shopping patterns proved to be a pretty seamless analogy to shopping for personal loan investments. In the future, I think we could test even more shopping patterns - like showing investment trends or comparing options.</li>

                    <p>There are a number of tweaks I'd like to make to this feature now that it's released. Here are a few:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Approachability And Learning.</b> The experience right now is catered mainly to intermediate and experienced investors. With a few tweaks, we can simplify complex copy and provide guidance to get novice users started.</li>
                        <li><b>Personalization And Empathy.</b> I explored a few different ways to make finance feel more human. With more fine-tuning, I think we can improve the personalization many of our investors appreciate.</li>
                        <li><b>Save For Later.</b> I discovered that some investors prefer to shop, tentatively add investments to their cart, and come back later to purchase. Unfortunately, the app doesn't support this functionality today.</li>
