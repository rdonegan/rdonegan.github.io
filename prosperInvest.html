                    <p>Prosper was the first company in the US to allow peer-to-peer lending and borrowing. In August 2019, Prosper launched Prosper Invest to allow allow investors to manage and add to their portfolios on-the-go.</p>

                    <h4>LISTENING TO OUR USERS</h4>
                    <p>The feedback since the app's launch was loud and clear: <b>users appreciated the streamlined design of the app, but some wanted more control.</b></p>

                    <p>At release, the app allowed users to invest automatically based on criteria they set themselves. However, a subset of our user base vocalized the desire to invest manually - a feature available to them on the web version of the app. We sought to understand this feedback more deeply to address it on mobile.</p>

                    <p>I conducted 2 user tests across 10 participants to observe our web and mobile UI in practice. I found that <b>even the most experienced investors found our web experience dense and difficult to navigate</b>. More experienced investors tended to browse and invest more quickly. Investors of novice to intermediate experience were more deliberate.</p>

                    <p>I assumed that investors were more comfortable with familiar patterns like online shopping. To test this assumption, I drafted low-fi concepts and put them in front of investors. I found that the patterns of adding to cart, filtering results, and checking out all resonated.</p>

                    <p>As investors browsed options, <b>I observed that yield is the first "gate" investors need to pass to determine if a loan is worth their investment.</b></p>

                    <p>Next, some investors sought details on the borrower and financial history associated with each loan. For this reason, I knew it was important to prioritize information affecting the viability of an investment - yield and investment grade - while giving a clear pathway to all the granular details.</p>

                    <p>I explored both layout and content. Visually, I grappled with the ability to show more listings on the screen vs. easier comparison. Eventually, I opted for a single column card layout. This allowed users to more easily scan and compare listings.</p>

                    <p>Usage date from our web platform showed that roughly <b>30% of investors never look beyond the summary for each investment</b>. The other 70% review each investment in detail before deciding to invest. I dubbed these personas Scanners and Power-Shoppers, respectively.</p>

                    <p>Scanners are primarily motivated by diversification, and rely mainly on the grade and yield of each option to invest. Power-shoppers on the other hand are particularly risk averse, and truly want to understand the likelihood a loan will be paid back at a more granular level.</p>

                    <p><b>My goal was to support Scanners who select many investments at once, while enabling Power-Shoppers to dive in for details on a loan and borrower.</b></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Strict Info Hierarchy.</b> Early discovery suggested that information overload is a huge deterrent for new and even intermediate investors. Limited mobile real estate reinforced the need to prioritize only the most critical information.</li>
                        <li><b>Familiar Patterns.</b> Mobile shopping patterns proved to be a pretty seamless analogy to shopping for personal loan investments. In the future, I think we could test even more shopping patterns - like showing investment trends or comparing options.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Approachability And Learning.</b> The experience right now is catered mainly to intermediate and experienced investors. With a few tweaks, we can simplify complex copy and provide guidance to get novice users started.</li>
                        <li><b>Personalization And Empathy.</b> I explored a few different ways to make finance feel more human. With more fine-tuning, I think we can improve the personalization many of our investors appreciate.</li>
                        <li><b>Save For Later.</b> I discovered that some investors prefer to shop, tentatively add investments to their cart, and come back later to purchase. Unfortunately, the app doesn't support this functionality today.</li>
