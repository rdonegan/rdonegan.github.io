                            <p><strong>Context.</strong> Prosper is an online, peer-to-peer personal loan solution.
                            </p>


                            <p><strong>Problem.</strong> About 75% of loan applicants abandon after finding they're ineligible for a loan. Applicants feel confused and frustrated, despite being offered more options.
                            </p>

                            <p><strong>Partner.</strong> We partnered with loan provider, AmOne, to offer customers this experience.

                             <p><strong>My role.</strong> I led research and worked with a designer to optimize the UI and copy. We collaborated with Product and our legal team to explore this problem area.
                            </p>

                            <p><strong>Result.</strong> Our revamped concept saw a conversion increase from 25% to 65%, with more people choosing to explore their options with AmOne after a decline from Prosper.

                    <h4>CONTEXT</h4>
                    <p>Prosper offers fixed term, low interest personal loans. Applicants complete a multi-step form to check their eligibility with no impact to their credit score. Ultimately, applicants either receive a loan offer or are found ineligible.</p>

                    <h4>THE PROBLEM</h4>
                    <p>For some ineligible applicants, Prosper offers the opportunity to instantly apply with a partner lender: AmOne. Although they're ineligible for a loan through Prosper, these applicants possess a credit score and income level that may qualify them for an AmOne loan.<p>

                    <p><b>Only 25% of Prosper applicants chose to apply with AmOne, while other lenders partnering with AmOne saw conversion averaging ~55%.</b></p>

                    <h4>METHOD</h4>
                    <p>To deal with an optimization challenge like this, I suggested we step back to map existing user journeys. We could layer on learnings from user interviews and comparative analysis to expose the pain points of these journeys.</p>

                    <p><b>I partnered with a fellow designer to answer: why this discrepancy in conversion, and what part of that is attributed to customer experience?</b></p>

                    <p>Although our conversion problem tracked to a single page, I expected that its origins were linked to the broader customer journey. <b>We observed that an applicant must first fill out 9-13 pages of information before ever seeing this decline pathway.

                    <p>We ran a user test on 5 participants. All participants were asked to apply for a personal loan with Prosper. At the end of their application, each participant was shown the existing decline message.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><b>All participants were surprised by the decline page.</b> Participants expected to see details on their loan offer.</li>
                        <li><b>Customers felt the application was a waste of time.</b> Plus, none of the participants understood that continuing with AmOne would <i>not</i> require they reenter their info.</li>
                        <li><b>Applicants thought the message looked like an ad</b>. After completing an application with sensitive personal information, this was not received well.</li>

                    <p>One of our assumptions was that the hybrid visual approach of the existing page wasn't working. <b>Users were confused why part of the page looked like it belonged to Prosper and other parts belonged to AmOne.</b></p>

                    <p>We hypothesized that by more clearly distinguishing the AmOne brand from Prosper's, we could improve transparency and thus trust. We tested this by separating the Prosper notice at the top of the page from a dedicated AmOne panel, and intentionally incorporating AmOne colors.</p>

                    <p>Participants did not respond well to the AmOne branding, and reported it still felt like an ad. Plus, only 1 user of 5 tested noticed the helpful bullets we added to summarize the bulky disclosure.</p>

                    <p><b>Now, we hypothesized that by making the decline experience feel like the next step of the application, we could reduce surprise and frustation.</b> For the next concept, we adjusted all panels and colors to match Prosper styles.</p>

                    <p>We aimed to build trust and transparency through our work. That goal partially manifested in a strict requirement that the AmOne disclosure appear legibly <i>above</i> the CTA. We could play with how this information appeared, but it was important that our customers understand this step before moving forward.</p>

                        <li><b>Focus on the opportunity:</b> With some copy tweaks, we found that focusing the page on opportunity rather than a decline encouraged applicants to expore their options.</li>
                        <li><b>Transparency:</b> To unlock the CTA and see their options, users must read the full disclosure (via scroll). Early test results indicated that this was a well known and successful pattern.</li>
