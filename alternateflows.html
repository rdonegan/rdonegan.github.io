                        <div class="col-sm-6">
                            <p><strong>Problem.</strong> 75% of loan applicants abandon Prosper after being told they're ineligible but may have more options. How do we expose those options, and encourage more users to learn more?
                            </p>

                            <p><strong>Constraints.</strong> We partnered with loan provider, AmOne, to offer customers this experience. Terms and conditions needed to be clear for both AmOne and Prosper (more on that below).

                             <p><strong>My role.</strong> I worked with one other designer to share research, UX, and UI responsibilities. We collaborated with a product manager and our legal team to explore this problem area.
                            </p>

                            <p><strong>Result.</strong> Our revamped concept saw a conversion increase from 25% to 65%, with more people choosing to explore their options with AmOne after a decline from Prosper.

                    <h4>THE PROBLEM</h4>
                    <p>Prosper offers fixed term, low interest personal loans $2,000 - $40,000. To check eligibility, applicants apply online through a multi-step form. At the end of the form, applicants either receive a loan offer, or are found ineligible.</p>

                    <p>For a subset of ineligible applicants, Prosper offers the opportunity to check loan rates with a partner lender: AmOne. This applicant subset is deemed eligible due to a variety of criteria like FICO score, income band, etc. The problem was that the <b>conversion from Prosper to the AmOne interface hovered around 25%, while similar competitors implemented solutions averaging ~50%</b>.</p>

                    <p>We asked: why this discrepancy, and how is that linked to conversion?</p>

                    <h4>DISCOVERING THE DECLINE FLOW</h4>
                    <p>First, we needed to understand the response to the existing experience. Quantitatively, something looked very wrong. Qualitatively, we expected to dig into some of the problems leading to the concerning numbers.</p>

                    <p>We ran a quick and dirty user test on the existing UI. To simulate the experience more realistically, we asked 5 participants to walk through a full Prosper application. On the back end, we setup all applications to conclude with a decline and AmOne offer. Based on our research, we observed the following:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><b>All participants were surprised and some frustrated</b> by the decline page. Although the application should have been preparing them for a possible failure, everyone was thrown by the end result.</li>
                        <li>The <b>perception of time wasted</b> was noted verbally. After completing a multi-page application, users were not happy with the final result. Furthermore, none of the participants understood that continuing with AmOne would <i>not</i> require they reenter their info.</li>
                        <li>People thought Prosper and AmOne were <b>selling too hard</b>. Something about the look and feel of the decline page in particular made people view the offer as advertisement. This was not received well.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                    <h4>TRYING NEW THINGS</h4>
                    <p>With qualitative insight, we went back to the drawing board. We sketched different concepts, and ran user tests to validate our assumptions.</p>

                    <p>One of our assumptions was that the hybrid visual approach of the existing page wasn't working. Users were confused why part of the page looked like it belonged to Prosper and other parts belonged to AmOne.</p>

                    <p><b>We hypothesized that by <i>more</i> clearly distinguishing the AmOne brand from Prosper's, we could improve transparency and thus trust</b>. We tested this by separating the Prosper notice at the top of the page from a dedicated AmOne panel, and intentionally incorporating AmOne colors.</p>

                    <p><b>Now, we hypothesized that by making the decline experience feel like the next step of the application, we could reduce surprise and frustation.</b></p>

                    <p>We adjusted the panel width to match those of all proceeding application steps. All fonts, colors, and CTA's were brought into accord with the Prosper style as well.</p>

                    <p>This stylistic approach was a noteworthy success over other trials. Next, we focused on refining copy and the dislosure text.</p>

                    <p>A goal of the project was to build customers' trust through transparency. We recognized the risk of introducing a page like this and impact it may have on customers who find it unsolicited.</p>

                    <p>That goal manifested in a strict requirement that the AmOne disclosure needed to appear above the CTA in a legible, clear form. Design-wise, we could play with how this information appeared, but it was important that our customers understand this step before moving forward.</p>

                    <p><b>Although it increased page height - particularly for mobile - perceived trust from test participants was moderate to high.</b></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Copy is key: we found that by focusing the page on opportunity rather than a decline, users were more inclined to pursue their options.</li>
                        <li>Continuity: We used Prosper styles to make the page feel like the next step in the application. Although some participants were frustrated by the decline, they were no longer surprised by the page itself.</li>
                        <li>Highlighting transparency: To unlock the CTA and see their options, users must read for the full disclosure (via scroll). Contrary to our expectation, test results validated this as a well known and successful pattern. </li>
