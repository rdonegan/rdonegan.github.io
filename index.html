									<p><strong>My Role.</strong> Collaborating mainly with three other UI designers and researchers, I spearheaded the location page redesign effort from conception to finalization. As part of my role, I conducted initial customer interviews, performed heuristic evaluation, and analyzed page analytics. I was also responsible for ideation, sketching, and wireframing. As part of the design process, I socialized my designs and received feedback to incorporate into future iterations. I worked with other designers and project leaders to establish business rules based on my designs. 
									</p>

								</div>

								<div class="small-12 medium-6 columns">
									<p><strong>Constraints.</strong> I had to ensure that final designs were on-brand and consistent with established patterns. Designs had to be both technically feasible, as well as cognizant of the page owners responsible for maintaining location pages.
									</p>

									<p><strong>Result.</strong> A design pleasing for employees and manageable for each location’s page owners. In my final iterations, I proposed a design that promoted clarity and efficiency, and was scalable for many different locations. This included a revised information hierarchy, and the addition of a new room-finding component.
									</p>

								</div>

							</div>
							<p><strong>Process.</strong> I followed an iterative process that began with user research and finished with a high-level page template and UI design specs.</p>
							
							<p><i>Research:</i></p>
							
							<p>I performed a <strong>heuristic evaluation</strong> on the current location pages, <strong> analyzed page behavior and trends </strong>, and conducted <strong>customer interviews </strong>regarding location page use and awareness. </p>

							<br>
							<p>Key Insight:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Activity on location pages is varied.</li>
								<li>People do not use pages to browse.</li>
								<li>Location pages are like portals.</li>
								<li>Location pages are used in conjunction with other tasks or pages.</li>

							<p>I began sketching to solve for the use cases and insight I had identified, as well as to further my understanding of where Insight pages were lacking. I started from broad concepts affecting the location page experience, and gradually narrowed my focus to the component level.</p>

							<p>I developed several design objectives for this project:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Apply a consistent layout.</li>
								<li>Improve information surfacing and efficiency.</li>
								<li>Reduce clutter and increase clarity.</li>
								<li>Make an experience that is scalable.</li>

							<p><i>Design Refinement:</i></p>



							<p>One of my early decisions was deciding between a three-column or two-column approach. Although most of Insight was designed in two-columns, I felt a three-column modular layout helped differentiate location pages from other content pages. Additionally, my research showed that people used location pages as “portals”, and thus I hoped a change in column structure would reflect the nature of these pages in context. Three columns also allowed more space for growth in the future.</p>

								<div class="small-12 medium-6 columns">
									<p><strong>The Client.</strong> Zero Waste Pennsylvania (ZWPA) is a non-profit seeking to reduce waste generated by organizations throughout Pennsylvania. As part of its work, ZWPA performs waste audits in order to identify how trash, recycling, and compost can be better disposed of within an organization’s waste infrastructure. 
									</p>

									<p><strong>The Task.</strong> Initially, all of ZWPA's records were handwritten and recorded on a series of paper documents. No formal content organization existed, and ZWPA lacked a way to archive records. Our task was to examine the pain points of this process in order to design and implement a technical solution. Additionally, we considered app extensibility, accessibility, and ease-of-use. Acting as consultants, we adapted our approach based on project developments.
									</p>

								</div>

								<div class="small-12 medium-6 columns">
									<p><strong>My Role.</strong> As design lead on a team of four, I drove efforts to first understand ZWPA’s current process as well as identify how design could be employed to help ZWPA better achieve its goals. I was also involved in the front-end development of the final app.
									</p>

									<p><strong>Constraints.</strong> Our team was challenged to provide a sustainable solution within ZWPA’s technical and financial means. We considered how the current process could best be represented with technology, as well as what was feasible based on budget.
									</p>

									<p><strong>Result.</strong> A deployed web app that integrates with key phases of the ZWPA’s waste audit process. With the ZWPA app, waste auditors can initiate, record, and archive key features of the waste audit process with clients.
									</p>

								</div>

							</div>

							<p><strong>Process.</strong> Our team followed an agile methodology which consisted of weeklong sprints. Following each sprint, we would determine new objectives and where we needed to iterate or work further. </p>

							<p><i>Research & Data Gathering:</i></p>

							<p>Initially, my team started by creating a workflow and affinity diagram based on ZWPA interviews and observing their workspace. Based on our research, our team chose to address several key issues: </p>
								<ul><strong>
								<li>Eliminating ZWPA’s reliance on paper documents.</li>
								<li>Creating an efficient and reliable interface for archiving and documenting audits.</li>
								<li>Taking advantage of ZWPA’s access to tablet technology. </li></strong>
							</ul></p>

							<p><i>Database Design & Ideation:</i></p>

							<p> The most critical points of the process involved creating an initial client account, conducting an initial client questionnaire, and performing an actual waste audit. Given the mobile nature of waste auditing, our team determined it would be best to design a responsive solution. By designing for tablet as well as mobile, we hoped to improve overall project accessibility.</p>

							<p>We began by generating an ERD representative of the current audit process, as well as a revised ERD of an ideal process that would allow ZWPA to expand its current offerings and serve more organizations in the future. This laid the groundwork for our initial sketches and wireframes, which we designed for tablet:</p>

								</div>
							</div></br>

							<p><i>Testing & Development:</i></p>

							<p>Through feedback incorporated from ZWPA field-testing, we added image capture functionality as well as the ability to export reports to Excel for our MVP release. While time constraints did not allow the team to create a functional graphing applet, by exporting reports to Excel we were able to alleviate much of the manual work ZWPA members previously had to perform.</p>

							<p><strong>Part 1: Brainstorming &amp; Idea Validation</strong></p>

							<p>FitMate was conceived on the basis of two broad hypotheses: many people like to exercise + many people would like to exercise with others. Our initial concept for FitMate allowed mobile users to quickly browse and locate compatible workout partners in their area. Following a lean methodology, I worked on a team to research, ideate, and iterate on this idea. </p>

							<p>We began by validating our hypotheses through a series of ‘speed-dating’ activities performed with stakeholders. To brainstorm the key user stories satisfied by FitMate, each member of the team created a short storyboard. Our storyboards mainly focused on the intent of users. Originally, we envisioned FitMate as appealing to people’s desire to stay healthy and get in shape. We tested this by creating five separate user scenarios and storyboards and asking potential users to walk through them in a ‘speed-dating’ format.</p>

							</div><br>



							<p>We found that, encouragingly, people generally prefer working out with others if given the option. Interestingly, <strong>specific forms of exercise appeal to partner or group workouts more than others</strong>. Likewise, most respondents reported that they were <strong>more inclined to workout with people in their community</strong> (friends, classmates, coworkers, etc).</p>

							<div class="row">
								<div class="small-12 medium-5 large-4 columns">
									<p>Based on this feedback, we found that we needed to narrow our focus, from all exercises, to running - an activity frequently performed in groups. This allowed us to focus FitMate's UI.</p>

									<p>We also pivoted our idea to align more with the social desire we discovered. Rather than focus on matching FitMate users with compatible workout partners, we envisioned an experience that would leverage social connections in friend and community groups. Timing was an issue frequently referenced in interviews, and so we adapted our approach to enable scheduling rather than spontaneous meetups. </p>

									<p class="show-for-large-only">Additionally, we noted the appeal of FitMate to a younger audience: college students, specifically. This group had shown particular interest in leveraging social interactions within FitMate - a feature we had originally overlooked. Thus, we planned to test a model of FitMate that incorporated gamification, allowing users to challenge their friends to running events and races.</p>

							</div>


							

							<p><strong>Phase 2: Brand & Prototyping</strong></p>

							<p>We explored our concept visually by experimenting with branding and presentation. In the end, we narrowed on two contrasting brands - a minimalist approach focused on the challenge aspect of the app, as well as a more traditional, verbose brand evocative of the app’s health benefits. We created two sample landing page variants based on these and used A/B testing to gauge their effectiveness. </p>

									</div>
									
								</div>								


							</div><br>

							<p>Using Illustrator and Flinto, we created mid to high-fidelity prototypes of FitMate for testing. Our prototypes focused on key elements of our concept such as finding and meeting a running buddy. We also tested experimental features such as challenging friends to races in exchange for running swag and prizes. To get a better sense of the successes/failures of our app in practice, we utilized concierge service testing in combination with prototypes. We simulated this in part by recruiting people who had never met and scheduling a time for them to run together.</p>

							<div class="small-12 columns">
									<div class="row">
										<a class="popup-link" href="images/portfolio/msi-prototype.png"><img src="images/portfolio/high-res/msi-prototype.jpg"></a>
									</div>
									
							</div>

							<p>Overall, testing showed results largely in favor of the social changes we had made to the application. Users were excited by the opportunity to incorporate their friends and members of the community into their app experience, and found the gaming inclusion interesting. In our A/B testing, our minimalist brand was favored more by visitors as well, suggesting an emphasis on playfulness.</p>

							<p>On the other hand, test participants were somewhat skeptical of the concept of meeting complete strangers to workout. To reinforce a feeling of security within FitMate, we pivoted our approach to be based more firmly on finding running partners within a community rather than randomly in an area. We included this concept in our later prototypes and received more positive feedback. </p>

							<p><strong>Part 3: Pitching the App</strong></p>

							<p>We concluded from our findings that FitMate successfully catered to three phases of the user experience: pre-run, run, and post-run. </p>

							<p>However, we discovered a challenge of FitMate was continued use (i.e. why would someone continue using FitMate after finding and identifying a substantial group of running partners?). As important as it was to make the pre-run search for workout partners easy, the followup of post-run was critical for encouraging return users. </p>

							<p>In response, we identified an unaddressed use case in organized racing. Currently, the process for registering for and being notified of local races is dispersed. By leveraging the active running community of FitMate, we envisioned giving users the ability to browse, register for, and challenge friends to participate in upcoming races. This functionality appealed to both our goals of gamification as well as socialization. </p>

									</div>
									
								</div>								


							</div><br>

							<p>We created high-fidelity mockups encompassing our newly-defined customer journey model and app concept. Based on feedback that suggested women would be more responsive to group workouts, we  adjusted our mockups to appeal more to a female audience. Visually, it was important to convey both friendliness and security, which we attempted by reigning in some of the color choices from our previous prototypes and realigning with a lighter teal. This color scheme and design we felt gave a softer appearance, less jarring than some of our previous explorations.</p>

							<p>To continue the lean process, we created a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/888350120/2092080571?token=209cc371"> Kickstarter </a> campaign for FitMate and video.</p>

							<p>Our goal with this project was to construct a simplified, single-page experience to satisfy a client need. We utilized the Instagram API to draw on recently shared images - ensuring different results and experiences with each new query. To reduce any learning curves, we consolidated all interactions within a single side-bar from which all critical tasks can be performed. From this control center, users can enter new queries, review recommended search terms (for inspiration), and control their menu.</p>

							<p>Tasked with proposing improvements to the current system of scheduling external speakers and guests, my team began by performing observations. Our goal was to understand the AA’s process of scheduling visitors on campus. Our observations included related tasks such as reimbursement and managing travel arrangements.</p>

							<p>Based on our observations, we interpreted our notes into flow and sequence models. We recorded the various roles involved in the scheduling process, as well as noted any breakdowns in the current system. This allowed us to identify the primary players in a typical flow (the AA and visitor) as well as auxiliary interactors (reimbursement department, travel agency, hotel, catering company, AA supervisor).</p>

							<p>To get a better sense of how the responsibilities of these various groups interacted, we then focused our attention on consolidating our notes - observing where there was overlap and where users had similar feedback. We compiled our findings in an affinity diagram and consolidated flow model.</p>

							<p>Our findings allowed us to identify the key pain points throughout visitor scheduling. We divided these primary procedural breakdowns into two groups: “Pre-Visit” and “Post-Visit”. We found that most of the work done by AA’s occurred within these two phases, and that a successful “Pre-Visit” often resulted in an easier “Post-Visit”. Based on this, we identified three primary goals for our process redesign:</p>

							<ul><strong>
								<li>Re-evaluate communication system between AA and visitor.</li>
								<li>Address difficulties in extracting visitor information for the AA.</li>
								<li>Facilitate use of information & data in the future (i.e. in the post-visit).</li></strong>


							</ul>

							<p>Our group iterated through a variety of solutions, using modeling and sketching to brainstorm. We tried to target one breakdown in particular in order to design an <strong>elegant</strong>, <strong>robust solution </strong> making use of <strong>existing processes and technology</strong>. We settled on a design we felt would be most effective in facilitating the pre-visit process as well as future data retrieval.</p>

							<a class="popup-link" href="images/portfolio/high-res/visions.png"><img src="images/portfolio/visions.jpg"></a>

							<p>Our final solution took advantage of the email correspondence already utilized by AA’s when communicating with prospective visitors. In its proposed form, our system would allow for the AA to send one, unified form to a designated recipient for data gathering purposes.</p>

							<p>The form would allow for entry of all standard information requested by AA’s before a visit (travel arrangements, date of arrival, guests, etc.) while avoiding the back-and-forth commonly observed in order to retrieve such information. Collected data would then be stored in a database, organized by visitor.</p>

							<p>Making use of an accessible database would nullify some of the issues involved in organizing and retrieving information - particularly paper records from past dates. AA’s would be able to easily gather and review information to use in future processes, as well as update incorrect / inconsistent data per request of the visitor.</p>

							<p>We presented our complete findings and vision to other students as well as campus Administrative Assistants. Our vision we represented by sketch:</p>

							<a class="popup-link" href="images/portfolio/high-res/vision_walkthroughhr.png"><img src="images/portfolio/vision_walkthrough.jpg"></a><br><br>

							<p>We determined that key impediments to our proposal were cost & time, security, and user training & education. If allowed more time, future iterations of our revitalized system would have had to address these components.</p>

							<p>Working within the content and constraints I was assigned, I was challenged with how to present the given information in a logical layout. I also hoped to incorporate some of Warhol’s artistic flair.</p>

							<a class="popup-link" href="images/portfolio/high-res/miller_homehr.png"><img src="images/portfolio/miller1.jpg"></a>

							<p>To best market the exhibit, it was important that I chose an architecture that wouldn’t detract from the main objective of the site. Thus, I designed a simplified navigation (“The Artist”, “The Exhibit”, “The Event”).</p>

							<p>In my designs, I also experimented with more ‘Warholian’ colors and layout, yet I ultimately chose a more grounded approach. Here, color is used sparingly to identify areas of attention and interactivity. This I hoped would bring the content to the forefront, while also eliciting some of Warhol’s trademark style.</p>

							<p>My first iterations experimented with how font size, typographic weight, and other graphical elements affected my composition. From this phase, I obtained a sense of how different visual factors could affect a viewer's perception of the given material.</p>


							<p>In my first attempt at unifying design and content, I chose what I believed to be a minimalist layout. I designed the school name as the clear point of entry, followed by a progressive listing of subsequent events. I used color sparingly to differentiate each information block, hopefully enabling quick viewing.</p>

							<p>I experimented with a background color in my next iteration - the theory being that my previous design might not have been easily differentiated when placed beside other posters. In doing so, I felt I sacrificed too much in the way of information clarity. Additionally, I received feedback that line I had used to direct attention throughout the poster had become too dominant.</p>

							<p>For my final design I focused on distinguishing content from the negative space. Thus, I slightly increased the font size of the event headings, and decreased the stroke of the white, directional line. I also added a complementary blue fill to diversify the background intensity, while also creating the illusion of a skyline.</p>
