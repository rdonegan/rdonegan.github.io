							<p>Simply, FeedMe allows users to input their craving of choice and browse how others have recently enjoyed similar cravings. Users’ preferences are added to a customizable menu from which new foods or dishes can be added and removed per the preference of the specific user. With a few simple queries, hungry clients can be motivated to create inspired works of culinary art.</p>

							<p>Our goal with this project was to construct a simplified, single-page experience to satisfy a client need. We utilized the Instagram API to draw on recently shared images - ensuring different results and experiences with each new query. To reduce any learning curves, we consolidated all interactions within a single side-bar from which all critical tasks can be performed. From this control center, users can enter new queries, review recommended search terms (for inspiration), and control their menu.</p>

							<p>To demonstrate FeedMe’s user workflow, I used Adobe Photoshop to mockup a potential interface to help guide development:</p>

							<p>During my time, I collaborated on several client-facing products including the athenaNet Device Manager (ADM). The ADM was planned to allow clients to more efficiently view devices connected to their athenaNet account. Because the ADM was planned to be an installable Windows application, a major project goal was to incorporate the ADM within athenaNet's cloud-based interface.</p>
							<p>Working alongside other designers, developers, and product innovators, I helped develop a clear set of project goals and MVP requirements. Tasked with focusing on the Windows interface portion of the application, I iterated from low to high-fidelity wireframes and mockups, working closely with my team members to ensure product cohesion. After finalization of designs, I continued close communication with members of the development team to ensure an accurate translation from design to engineering.</p>
							<p>To coincide with athenaNet’s 'reskin-ed' release, I also worked on a team charged with evaluating and establishing patterns within the UX department. As one of my individual assignments, I created an icon reference guide to facilitate design inconsistencies between outdated and updated versions of athenaNet.</p>

							<p>A key component of my project was the use of usability research. I utilized data gathered from my findings to visualize my users' preferred mental model - eventually creating an icon taxonomy based upon this data. The guide was released to the UX department for use upon the conclusion of my internship.</p>

							<p>Tasked with proposing improvements to the current system of scheduling external speakers and guests, my team began by performing observations. Our goal was to understand the AA’s process of scheduling visitors on campus. Our observations included related tasks such as reimbursement and managing travel arrangements.</p>

							<p>Based on our observations, we interpreted our notes into flow and sequence models. We recorded the various roles involved in the scheduling process, as well as noted any breakdowns in the current system. This allowed us to identify the primary players in a typical flow (the AA and visitor) as well as auxiliary interactors (reimbursement department, travel agency, hotel, catering company, AA supervisor).</p>

							<a target="_blank" href="images/portfolio/high-res/sequence.jpg"><img src="images/portfolio/sequence.jpg"/></a><br><br>

							<p>To get a better sense of how the responsibilities of these various groups interacted, we then focused our attention on consolidating our notes - observing where there was overlap and where users had similar feedback. We compiled our findings in an affinity diagram and consolidated flow model.</p>

							<div class="row">

								</div>
							</div> <br>
							<p>Our findings allowed us to identify the key pain points throughout visitor scheduling. We divided these primary procedural breakdowns into two groups: “Pre-Visit” and “Post-Visit”. We found that most of the work done by AA’s occurred within these two phases, and that a successful “Pre-Visit” often resulted in an easier “Post-Visit”. Based on this, we identified three primary goals for our process redesign:</p>

							<ul><strong>
								<li>Re-evaluate communication system between AA and visitor.</li>
								<li>Address difficulties in extracting visitor information for the AA.</li>
								<li>Facilitate use of information & data in the future (i.e. in the post-visit).</li></strong>


							</ul>

							<p>Our group iterated through a variety of solutions, using modeling and sketching to brainstorm. We tried to target one breakdown in particular in order to design an <strong>elegant</strong>, <strong>robust solution </strong> making use of <strong>existing processes and technology</strong>. We settled on a design we felt would be most effective in facilitating the pre-visit process as well as future data retrieval.</p>

							<a target="_blank" href="images/portfolio/high-res/visions.png"><img src="images/portfolio/visions.jpg"/></a>

							<p>Our final solution took advantage of the email correspondence already utilized by AA’s when communicating with prospective visitors. In its proposed form, our system would allow for the AA to send one, unified form to a designated recipient for data gathering purposes.</p>

							<p>The form would allow for entry of all standard information requested by AA’s before a visit (travel arrangements, date of arrival, guests, etc.) while avoiding the back-and-forth commonly observed in order to retrieve such information. Collected data would then be stored in a database, organized by visitor.</p>

							<p>Making use of an accessible database would nullify some of the issues involved in organizing and retrieving information - particularly paper records from past dates. AA’s would be able to easily gather and review information to use in future processes, as well as update incorrect / inconsistent data per request of the visitor.</p>

							<p>We presented our complete findings and vision to other students as well as campus Administrative Assistants. Our vision we represented by sketch:</p>

							<a target="_blank" href="images/portfolio/high-res/vision_walkthroughhr.png"><img src="images/portfolio/vision_walkthrough.jpg"></a><br><br>

							<p>We determined that key impediments to our proposal were cost & time, security, and user training & education. If allowed more time, future iterations of our revitalized system would have had to address these components.</p>

							<p>One of Overmoyer's core challenges was exciting customer loyalty in the face of growing industry rivals. As a group, we hoped to utilize technology to improve the customer service experience, while also allowing Overmoyer to meet more customer needs. Hence, my team created a semi-functional prototype of ‘Overmoyer Online’.</p>

							<p>As acting design lead, I hoped to initiate an experience that would be both intuitive and accessible. Additionally, I was challenged with preserving Overmoyer's mom-and-pop facade. Although by establishing an e-commerce presence our team hoped that Overmoyer's level of outreach would grow, it was important to maintain the personalized features many of Overmoyer's long-time clients had come to associate it with.</p>
							<p>To this extent, I incorporated more traditional features and layouts of current online retailers. I also avoided complex interfaces, tending towards a straightforward multi-column layout for the most part. I hoped this would alleviate some of the anxiety or unfamiliarity Overmoyer customers might face upon interacting with a new interface.</p>
							<p>While I did utilize many traditional e-commerce elements, I also recognized the need for specialization in Overmoyer’s niche market. To this effect, I streamlined the browsing process by initially presenting shoppers with 6 popular categories of bikes. From this, it is easy for shopper’s to browse various bike models, as well as view model specs.</p>

							<p>Customers may then view all bikes available within a certain category, easily browsing through pages as well as between categories as desired. The left column also provides for quick filtering by way of "Price" and "Brand", simplifying searches for customers with more specific criteria.</p>

							
							<p>Finlly, users are able to view the specs of each bike - a feature desired by many prospective customers. We hoped to augment the browsing and decision process by including additional features such as a ratings and comments section for each model. This worked dually to inform customer decisions while also evoking a sense of community that may have been lacking in previous Overmoyer initiatives.</p>
							<p>In accordance with Overmoyer's drive to reach a broad audience via the internet, my team included a live translation feature for all pages, as well as a Live Support option to field customer questions and concerns. While not fluidly integrated within the interface, we hoped these features would serve as representations of how Overmoyer's strategic plan would have focused future iterations.</p>

							<p>My first iterations experimented with how font size, typographic weight, and other graphical elements affected my composition. From this phase, I obtained a sense of how different visual factors could affect a viewer's perception of the given material.</p>


							<p>In my first attempt at unifying design and content, I chose what I believed to be a minimalist layout. I designed the school name as the clear point of entry, followed by a progressive listing of subsequent events. I used color sparingly to differentiate each information block, hopefully enabling quick viewing.</p>

							<p>I experimented with a background color in my next iteration - the theory being that my previous design might not have been easily differentiated when placed beside other posters. In doing so, I felt I sacrificed too much in the way of information clarity. Additionally, I received feedback that line I had used to direct attention throughout the poster had become too dominant.</p>

							<p>Simply informed that my design should appeal to academia, I chose to organize content in nested form. By organizing from high-level to low-level, I hoped to facilitate the experience of a reader looking for a particular section rather than someone reading straight through. This proved to be the most challenging aspect of this phase, as I attempted to include descriptive yet distinctive titles.</p>

							<p>Part 2: Going Mobile</p>

							<p>For this phase I was limited to designing three screens to both advertise and summarize the 'book' introduced in the Contents. Most difficult was including the book contents while accommodating the layout limitations of the iPhone. On the 'menu' screen, I simplified the Contents to super and sub-titles. Tapping a super-title reveals its sub-titles, which link to a section summary. For this, I removed the lowest-level chapter titles, as this level of detail would not be necessary for a brief summary. Finally, I hoped to make this menu more accessible by allowing users to either swipe right or tap the top left menu button to reveal it at any time.</p>
