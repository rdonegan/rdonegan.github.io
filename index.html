							<p>ZWPA is a non-profit seeking to reduce waste generated by organizations throughout Pennsylvania. As part of its initiatives, ZWPA performs waste audits in order to identify how trash, recycling, and compost can be better disposed of within an organization’s waste infrastructure.  </p>

							<p>As design lead on a team of four students, I drove efforts to first understand ZWPA’s current process as well as identify how design could be employed to help ZWPA better achieve its goals. Initially, my team started by creating a workflow and affinity diagram based on ZWPA interviews and observing their workspace. </p>

								<li>Creating an efficient and reliable interface for archiving and documenting audits.</li>
								<li>Taking advantage of ZWPA’s access to tablet technology. </li></strong>


							</ul></p>

							<p>Thus, my team worked to design and implement a web application that would digitize the audit process. With our application, ZWPA members are able to more efficiently complete audits in the field, as well as access important data from any internet-enabled device be it mobile, tablet, or desktop.</p>

								<p class="proj_intro">FitMate takes the hassle out of finding a running partner by connecting local runners with opportunities to meet, train, or race.

						<div class="small-12 columns description content-padding">

							<p><strong>Part 1: Brainstorming &amp; Idea Validation</strong></p>

							<p>FitMate was conceived as on the basis of two broad hypotheses: many people like to exercise + many people would like to exercise with others. Our initial concept for FitMate allowed mobile users to quickly browse and locate compatible workout partners in their area. Following a lean methodology, I worked on a team to research, ideate, and iterate on this idea. </p>

							<p>We began by validating our hypotheses through a series of ‘speed-dating’ activities performed with stakeholders. To brainstorm the key user stories satisfied by FitMate, each member of the team created a short storyboard. Our storyboards mainly focused on the intent of users in using an app like FitMate. Originally, we envisioned FitMate as appealing to people’s desire to stay healthy and get in shape. We tested this by creating five separate user scenarios and storyboards and asking potential users to walk through them in a ‘speed-dating’ format.</p>

							<div class="row align-center">

								<div class="small-12 columns">
									<div class="row">
										<a target="" href="images/portfolio/high-res/storyboard1-hr.jpg"><img src="images/portfolio/FitMate/storyboard1.jpg"></a>
									</div>

									</div>
								</div>								


							</div><br>



							<p>We found that, encouragingly, people generally prefer working out with others if given the option. Interestingly, <strong>specific forms of exercise appeal to partner or group workouts more than others</strong>. Likewise, most respondents reported that they were <strong>more inclined to workout with people in their community</strong> (friends, classmates, coworkers, etc).</p>

							<div class="row">
								<div class="small-12 medium-5 large-4 columns">
									<p>Based on this feedback in combination with additional survey and interview results, we found that we needed to narrow our focus from all exercises to running (an activity frequently performed in groups). This specialization would allow us to focus the UX of FitMate in a space that would benefit from our app’s value proposition.</p>

									<p>We also pivoted our idea to align more with the social, community desire we discovered. Rather than focus on matching FitMate users with compatible workout partners, we envisioned an experience that would leverage social connections in friend and community groups. Timing was an issue frequently referenced in interviews, and so we adapted our approach to enable scheduling rather than spontaneous meetups. </p>

								</div>

								<div class="small-12 medium-7 large-8 columns">
									<a target="" href="images/portfolio/high-res/ideation-1.jpg"><img src="images/portfolio/FitMate/ideation1.jpg"></a>
								</div>


							</div>


							<p>Additionally, we noted the appeal of FitMate to a younger audience: college students, specifically. This group had shown particular interest in leveraging social interactions within FitMate - a feature we had originally overlooked. Thus, we planned to test a model of FitMate that incorporated gamification, allowing users to challenge their friends to running events and races.</p>

							<p><strong>Phase 2: Brand & Prototyping</strong></p>

							<p>We explored our concept visually by experimenting with branding and presentation. In the end, we narrowed on two contrasting brands - a minimalist approach focused on the challenge aspect of the app, as well as a more traditional, verbose brand evocative of the app’s health benefits. We created two sample landing pages variants based on these and used A/B testing to gauge their effectiveness. </p>

							<div class="row align-center">

									<div class="row">
										<a target="" href="images/portfolio/FitMate/logo-collage.jpg"><img src="images/portfolio/FitMate/logo-collage.jpg"></a>
									</div>
									
								</div>								


							</div><br>

							<p>Using Illustrator and Flinto, we created mid to high-fidelity prototypes of FitMate for testing. Our prototypes focused on key elements our concept such as finding and meeting a running buddy. We also tested experimental features such as challenging friends to races in exchange for running swag and prizes. To get a better sense for the success/failures of our app in practice, we utilized concierge service testing in combination with prototypes. We simulated this in part by recruiting people who had never met and scheduling a time for them to run together.</p>

							<p>Overall, testing showed results largely in favor of the social changes we had made to the application. Users were excited by the opportunity to incorporate their friends and members of the community into their app experience, and found the gaming inclusion interesting. In our A/B testing, our minimalist brand was favored more by visitors as well, suggesting an emphasis on playfulness.</p>

							<p>On the other hand, test participants were somewhat skeptical of the concept of meeting complete strangers to workout. To reinforce a feeling of security within FitMate, we pivoted our approach to be based more firmly on finding running partners within a community rather than randomly in an area. We included this concept in our later prototypes and received more positive feedback. </p>

							<p><strong>Part 3: Pitching the App</strong></p>

							<p>We concluded from our findings that FitMate successfully catered to three phases of the user experience: pre-run, run, and post-run. </p>

							<p>However, we discovered a challenge of FitMate was continued use (i.e. why would someone continue using FitMate after finding and identifying a substantial group of running partners?). As important as it was to make the pre-run search for workout partner easy, the followup of post-run was critical for encouraging return users. </p>

							<p>In response, we identified an unaddressed use case in organized racing. Currently, the process for registering for and being notified of local races is dispersed. By leveraging the active running community of FitMate, we envisioned giving users the ability to browse, register for, and challenge friends to participate in upcoming races. This functionality appealed to both of our goals of gamification as well as socialization. </p>

							<p>We created high-fidelity mockups encompassing our newly-defined customer journey model and app concept. To continue the lean process, we created a <a target="" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/888350120/2092080571?token=209cc371"> Kickstarter </a> campaign for FitMate and video.</p>

							<p>Our goal with this project was to construct a simplified, single-page experience to satisfy a client need. We utilized the Instagram API to draw on recently shared images - ensuring different results and experiences with each new query. To reduce any learning curves, we consolidated all interactions within a single side-bar from which all critical tasks can be performed. From this control center, users can enter new queries, review recommended search terms (for inspiration), and control their menu.</p>

							<p>To demonstrate FeedMe’s user workflow, I used Adobe Photoshop to mockup a potential interface to help guide development:</p>

							<p>During my time, I collaborated on several client-facing products including the athenaNet Device Manager (ADM). The ADM was planned to allow clients to more efficiently view devices connected to their athenaNet account. Because the ADM was planned to be an installable Windows application, a major project goal was to incorporate the ADM within athenaNet's cloud-based interface.</p>
							<p>Working alongside other designers, developers, and product innovators, I helped develop a clear set of project goals and MVP requirements. Tasked with focusing on the Windows interface portion of the application, I iterated from low to high-fidelity wireframes and mockups, working closely with my team members to ensure product cohesion. After finalization of designs, I continued close communication with members of the development team to ensure an accurate translation from design to engineering.</p>
							<p>To coincide with athenaNet’s 'reskin-ed' release, I also worked on a team charged with evaluating and establishing patterns within the UX department. As one of my individual assignments, I created an icon reference guide to facilitate design inconsistencies between outdated and updated versions of athenaNet.</p>

							<p>A key component of my project was the use of usability research. I utilized data gathered from my findings to visualize my users' preferred mental model - eventually creating an icon taxonomy based upon this data. The guide was released to the UX department for use upon the conclusion of my internship.</p>

							<p>Tasked with proposing improvements to the current system of scheduling external speakers and guests, my team began by performing observations. Our goal was to understand the AA’s process of scheduling visitors on campus. Our observations included related tasks such as reimbursement and managing travel arrangements.</p>

							<p>Based on our observations, we interpreted our notes into flow and sequence models. We recorded the various roles involved in the scheduling process, as well as noted any breakdowns in the current system. This allowed us to identify the primary players in a typical flow (the AA and visitor) as well as auxiliary interactors (reimbursement department, travel agency, hotel, catering company, AA supervisor).</p>

							<a target="" href="images/portfolio/high-res/sequence.jpg"><img src="images/portfolio/sequence.jpg"/></a><br><br>

							<p>To get a better sense of how the responsibilities of these various groups interacted, we then focused our attention on consolidating our notes - observing where there was overlap and where users had similar feedback. We compiled our findings in an affinity diagram and consolidated flow model.</p>

							</div> <br>
							<p>Our findings allowed us to identify the key pain points throughout visitor scheduling. We divided these primary procedural breakdowns into two groups: “Pre-Visit” and “Post-Visit”. We found that most of the work done by AA’s occurred within these two phases, and that a successful “Pre-Visit” often resulted in an easier “Post-Visit”. Based on this, we identified three primary goals for our process redesign:</p>

							<ul><strong>
								<li>Re-evaluate communication system between AA and visitor.</li>
								<li>Address difficulties in extracting visitor information for the AA.</li>
								<li>Facilitate use of information & data in the future (i.e. in the post-visit).</li></strong>


							</ul>

							<p>Our group iterated through a variety of solutions, using modeling and sketching to brainstorm. We tried to target one breakdown in particular in order to design an <strong>elegant</strong>, <strong>robust solution </strong> making use of <strong>existing processes and technology</strong>. We settled on a design we felt would be most effective in facilitating the pre-visit process as well as future data retrieval.</p>

							<a target="" href="images/portfolio/high-res/visions.png"><img src="images/portfolio/visions.jpg"/></a>

							<p>Our final solution took advantage of the email correspondence already utilized by AA’s when communicating with prospective visitors. In its proposed form, our system would allow for the AA to send one, unified form to a designated recipient for data gathering purposes.</p>

							<p>The form would allow for entry of all standard information requested by AA’s before a visit (travel arrangements, date of arrival, guests, etc.) while avoiding the back-and-forth commonly observed in order to retrieve such information. Collected data would then be stored in a database, organized by visitor.</p>

							<p>Making use of an accessible database would nullify some of the issues involved in organizing and retrieving information - particularly paper records from past dates. AA’s would be able to easily gather and review information to use in future processes, as well as update incorrect / inconsistent data per request of the visitor.</p>

							<p>We presented our complete findings and vision to other students as well as campus Administrative Assistants. Our vision we represented by sketch:</p>

							<a target="" href="images/portfolio/high-res/vision_walkthroughhr.png"><img src="images/portfolio/vision_walkthrough.jpg"></a><br><br>

							<p>We determined that key impediments to our proposal were cost & time, security, and user training & education. If allowed more time, future iterations of our revitalized system would have had to address these components.</p>

							<p>In my first attempt at unifying design and content, I chose what I believed to be a minimalist layout. I designed the school name as the clear point of entry, followed by a progressive listing of subsequent events. I used color sparingly to differentiate each information block, hopefully enabling quick viewing.</p>

							<p>I experimented with a background color in my next iteration - the theory being that my previous design might not have been easily differentiated when placed beside other posters.
