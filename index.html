								<p class="proj_intro">Designed for non-profit, Zero Waste Pennsylvania (ZWPA), the ZWPA App aims to improve the waste auditing process by reducing reliance on paper records and streamlining content gathering </p><div class="dots">...</div>

							<p>ZWPA is a non-profit seeking to reduce waste generated by organizations throughout Pennsylvania. As part of its initiatives, ZWPA performs waste audits in order to identify how trash, recycling, and compost can be better disposed of within an organization’s waste infrastructure. Initially, all of ZWPA's records were handwritten and recorded on a series of paper documents later used to generate computerized reports. No formal content organization existed, and ZWPA lacked a way to archive and revisit past client requests.  </p>

							<p>As design lead on a team of four students, I drove efforts to first understand ZWPA’s current process as well as identify how design could be employed to help ZWPA better achieve its goals. Initially, my team started by creating a workflow and affinity diagram based on ZWPA interviews and observing their workspace. </p>

							<p>Based on our research, our team chose to address several key issues:
								<ul><strong>
								<li>Eliminating ZWPA’s reliance on paper documents.</li>
								<li>Creating an efficient and reliable interface for archiving and documenting audits.</li>
								<li>Taking advantage of ZWPA’s access to tablet technology. </li></strong>


							</ul></p>

							<p>Thus, my team worked to design and implement a web application that would digitize the audit process. With our application, ZWPA members are able to more efficiently complete audits in the field, as well as access important data from any internet-enabled device be it mobile, tablet, or desktop.</p>

							<p>Simply, FeedMe allows users to input their craving of choice and browse how others have recently enjoyed similar cravings. Users’ preferences are added to a customizable menu from which new foods or dishes can be added and removed per the preference of the specific user. With a few simple queries, hungry clients can be motivated to create inspired works of culinary art.</p>

							<p>Our goal with this project was to construct a simplified, single-page experience to satisfy a client need. We utilized the Instagram API to draw on recently shared images - ensuring different results and experiences with each new query. To reduce any learning curves, we consolidated all interactions within a single side-bar from which all critical tasks can be performed. From this control center, users can enter new queries, review recommended search terms (for inspiration), and control their menu.</p>

							<p>To demonstrate FeedMe’s user workflow, I used Adobe Photoshop to mockup a potential interface to help guide development:</p>

For our initial <a target="_blank" href="http://feedme-pran123.rhcloud.com/">MVP release</a>, however, we limited the functionality of image queries to simply allow redirection to the original Instagram page.</p>

								<h2>athenahealth UX Design | <div class="sub-title">Summer 2014</div> </h2>

							<p>During my time, I collaborated on several client-facing products including the athenaNet Device Manager (ADM). The ADM was planned to allow clients to more efficiently view devices connected to their athenaNet account. Because the ADM was planned to be an installable Windows application, a major project goal was to incorporate the ADM within athenaNet's cloud-based interface.</p>
							<p>Working alongside other designers, developers, and product innovators, I helped develop a clear set of project goals and MVP requirements. Tasked with focusing on the Windows interface portion of the application, I iterated from low to high-fidelity wireframes and mockups, working closely with my team members to ensure product cohesion. After finalization of designs, I continued close communication with members of the development team to ensure an accurate translation from design to engineering.</p>
							<p>To coincide with athenaNet’s 'reskin-ed' release, I also worked on a team charged with evaluating and establishing patterns within the UX department. As one of my individual assignments, I created an icon reference guide to facilitate design inconsistencies between outdated and updated versions of athenaNet.</p>

							<p>A key component of my project was the use of usability research. I utilized data gathered from my findings to visualize my users' preferred mental model - eventually creating an icon taxonomy based upon this data. The guide was released to the UX department for use upon the conclusion of my internship.</p>

							<p>Tasked with proposing improvements to the current system of scheduling external speakers and guests, my team began by performing observations. Our goal was to understand the AA’s process of scheduling visitors on campus. Our observations included related tasks such as reimbursement and managing travel arrangements.</p>

							<p>Based on our observations, we interpreted our notes into flow and sequence models. We recorded the various roles involved in the scheduling process, as well as noted any breakdowns in the current system. This allowed us to identify the primary players in a typical flow (the AA and visitor) as well as auxiliary interactors (reimbursement department, travel agency, hotel, catering company, AA supervisor).</p>

							<a target="_blank" href="images/portfolio/high-res/sequence.jpg"><img src="images/portfolio/sequence.jpg"/></a><br><br>

							<p>To get a better sense of how the responsibilities of these various groups interacted, we then focused our attention on consolidating our notes - observing where there was overlap and where users had similar feedback. We compiled our findings in an affinity diagram and consolidated flow model.</p>

							</div> <br>
							<p>Our findings allowed us to identify the key pain points throughout visitor scheduling. We divided these primary procedural breakdowns into two groups: “Pre-Visit” and “Post-Visit”. We found that most of the work done by AA’s occurred within these two phases, and that a successful “Pre-Visit” often resulted in an easier “Post-Visit”. Based on this, we identified three primary goals for our process redesign:</p>

							<ul><strong>
								<li>Re-evaluate communication system between AA and visitor.</li>
								<li>Address difficulties in extracting visitor information for the AA.</li>
								<li>Facilitate use of information & data in the future (i.e. in the post-visit).</li></strong>


							</ul>

							<p>Our group iterated through a variety of solutions, using modeling and sketching to brainstorm. We tried to target one breakdown in particular in order to design an <strong>elegant</strong>, <strong>robust solution </strong> making use of <strong>existing processes and technology</strong>. We settled on a design we felt would be most effective in facilitating the pre-visit process as well as future data retrieval.</p>

							<a target="_blank" href="images/portfolio/high-res/visions.png"><img src="images/portfolio/visions.jpg"/></a>

							<p>Our final solution took advantage of the email correspondence already utilized by AA’s when communicating with prospective visitors. In its proposed form, our system would allow for the AA to send one, unified form to a designated recipient for data gathering purposes.</p>

							<p>The form would allow for entry of all standard information requested by AA’s before a visit (travel arrangements, date of arrival, guests, etc.) while avoiding the back-and-forth commonly observed in order to retrieve such information. Collected data would then be stored in a database, organized by visitor.</p>

							<p>Making use of an accessible database would nullify some of the issues involved in organizing and retrieving information - particularly paper records from past dates. AA’s would be able to easily gather and review information to use in future processes, as well as update incorrect / inconsistent data per request of the visitor.</p>

							<p>We presented our complete findings and vision to other students as well as campus Administrative Assistants. Our vision we represented by sketch:</p>

							<a target="_blank" href="images/portfolio/high-res/vision_walkthroughhr.png"><img src="images/portfolio/vision_walkthrough.jpg"></a><br><br>

							<p>We determined that key impediments to our proposal were cost & time, security, and user training & education. If allowed more time, future iterations of our revitalized system would have had to address these components.</p>

							<p>My first iterations experimented with how font size, typographic weight, and other graphical elements affected my composition. From this phase, I obtained a sense of how different visual factors could affect a viewer's perception of the given material.</p>


							<p>In my first attempt at unifying design and content, I chose what I believed to be a minimalist layout. I designed the school name as the clear point of entry, followed by a progressive listing of subsequent events. I used color sparingly to differentiate each information block, hopefully enabling quick viewing.</p>

							<p>I experimented with a background color in my next iteration - the theory being that my previous design might not have been easily differentiated when placed beside other posters. In doing so, I felt I sacrificed too much in the way of information clarity. Additionally, I received feedback that line I had used to direct attention throughout the poster had become too dominant.</p>

							<p>For my final design I focused on distinguishing content from the negative space. Thus, I slightly increased the font size of the event headings, and decreased the stroke of the white, directional line. I also added a complementary blue fill to diversify the background intensity, while also creating the illusion of a skyline.</p>
