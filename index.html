									</p>

									<p><strong>My Role.</strong> I led the initiative as a Technology Consultant and was responsible for all design and development. I worked with the Palau Ministry of Education to set goals and evaluate solutions.
									</p>

								</div>

								<div class="small-12 medium-6 columns">
									<p><strong>Constraints.</strong> Due to Palau’s limited internet connectivity, the app would have to work almost entirely offline. Lesson plan requirements and expectations were set by the Ministry of Education.
									</p>

									<p><strong>Result.</strong> Released the Palau Lesson Planner app to all Palau public school teachers in grades 1-8. Held a training seminar and Q/A at a Palau educators’ conference to introduce the app prior to the beginning of the school year. 
									</p>

							<div class="desc_header"> <p><hr><strong>Process</strong><hr></p></div>

							<p><strong>Background Research</strong></p>

							<p>To gain an understanding of the lesson planning process, I researched the education system in Palau more broadly. I spoke to teachers and administrators, utilizing process artifacts such as lesson plans and performance reviews. I used primary documents to understand the process and expectations for completing lesson plans.</p>

							<br/><img src="images/portfolio/palau/document-analysis.jpg"><br/>

							<p><strong>Stakeholders and Personas</strong></p>

							<p>I identified four main stakeholders: Teachers, Students, the Ministry of Education, and School Administrators. Combined with background research, I created an overview for how information flowed between these stakeholders. I found that teachers are the bridge between students, administrators, and the MOE.</p>

							<p>From interviews with teachers, I noticed three broad personas emerging. I found it helpful to think about personas in terms of current process and views on technology. I noted it would be important to cater to all three personas, especially those hesitant to adopt new processes. </p>

							<br/><img src="images/portfolio/palau/stakeholder-flow.png"><br/>

							<br/><img src="images/portfolio/palau/personas.png"><br/>

							<p><strong>Requirements and Prioritization.</strong></p>

							<p>From research, I learned that teachers and students in Palau had been supplied with tablets for several years. Given the portability of tablets and the relative technical experience of most faculty, the tablet was the most appropriate medium for updating the lesson plan process.</p>

							<p>Thus, I established several broad goals I hoped to achieve over the course of the project:</p>

							<ol>
								<li>Supply primary app functionality</li>
								<li>Involve teachers in UX feedback</li>
								<li>Train and onboard teachers and faculty</li>
								<li>Address tech sustainability and robustness</li>
								<li>Limit the initial scope of the project to English and Math</li>
							</ol>

							<p><strong>Design Phase</strong></p>

							<p>I started by laying out the ideals I wanted to emulate through the UI:</p>

							<ul>
								<li>Improve efficiency and productivity in creating multiple lesson plans</li>
								<li>Anticipate teachers’ responses for common fields to save time</li>
								<li>Allow teachers flexibility,  such as in editing lesson plans</li>
								<li>Emulate the familiar aspects of the paper-based process</li>
							</ul>

							<p>My first sketches were very similar to the paper form teachers were already using. In these early phases, I focused more on content and organization rather than efficiency. I used these mockups to spur discussion early on with Palauan educators.</p>

							<p><strong>Integrating new features</strong></p>

							<p>Laying the groundwork with early designs led to new discoveries, and use cases I had assumed more nuanced became more prominent.</p>


							<p><i>Referring to curriculum standards</i><br>
								One of the most prominent pain points was the need for teachers to dissect a separate document containing all the standards, objectives, and resources valid for a subject and grade. I streamlined this process by allowing teachers to multi-select from a stored list directly in the app.
							</p>

							<p><i>Updating curriculum</i><br>
								The core curriculum - English, Math, Social Studies, Science, and Palauan - is updated annually. With this in mind, I made it a priority to allow the app to update when new content was available and an internet connection existed.
							</p>

							<p><i>Referring to past lesson plans</i><br>
								Teachers in Palau need to look back to past plans to determine if learning criteria were met and revise future lesson plans.
							</p>

							<p><i>Sharing</i><br>
								Teachers share lesson plans with principals and sometimes other teachers. Thus, the app allows plans to be exported locally or emailed if internet access is available.
							</p>

								</div>

							</div>

							<p><strong>Training</strong></p>

							<p>Acknowledging the people involved in the success of the app was crucial. In conjunction with development, I devoted time to training several employees at the Ministry of Education on how to update curriculum in the app. I created extensive documentation as result.</p>

							<p>Additionally, I held a training session at a convention held by the Ministry prior to the new school year. Teachers were able to attend as I introduced the app and allowed them to install and walk through on their own devices.</p>

							<p><strong>What’s next</strong></p>

							<p>I understood early on that the most difficult challenge would be encouraging teachers to engage. Before leaving Palau, I proposed an onboarding plan with members of the Ministry that involved training and frequent feedback collection. I also met with the Minister of Education to discuss incentivizing the app for teachers over paper. The goal was to create evangelists who would promote the app in classrooms through word of mouth.</p>

							<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

							<p>The Articulab at Carnegie Mellon is working to improve the understanding of education and children. The SCIPR project aims to bridge the gap between virtual agents, education, and the physical world. </p>

							<p>As part of my Human-Computer Interaction capstone, I worked on a team of five students to investigate collaborative virtual agent environments. We aimed to provide valuable insight on three criteria: <i>collaboration between virtual agents and children</i>, <i>curiosity and exploration</i>, and <i>player engagement</i>. </p>


							<p><strong>Initial Research</strong></p>

							<p>As part of our early research, we conducted a literature review, held interviews with industry experts, and analyzed best practices. Our research explored how virtual agents interact with children as well as how mixed-reality and technology can be used to facilitate these interactions. We found that:</p>

							<ul>
								<li>A robot with non-humanoid form can still elicit natural human interactions with a child.</li>
								<li>Virtual agents can interact effectively in some cases through the use of a proxy.</li>
								<li>Digital visualization and sensing can be as important to a successful experience as responsive actuation.</li>
							</ul>

							<br/><a class="popup-link" href="images/portfolio/virtualAgents/AffinityDiagram.jpg"><img src="images/portfolio/virtualAgents/AffinityDiagram.jpg"></a><br/>

							<p><strong>Design and Ideation</strong></p>

							<p>We began brainstorming approaches that would allow a virtual agent to interact with children in play. We sketched our ideas and organized our content into three broad categories: actuation, visualization, and sensing. </p>

							<br/><a class="popup-link" href="images/portfolio/virtualAgents/brainstorming1.jpg"><img src="images/portfolio/virtualAgents/brainstorming1.jpg"></a><br/>

							<p><strong>Low-fi prototype</strong></p>

							<p>For low-fidelity, we designed and tested two concepts: a physical proxy (aka Beepboop), and a digital physics game. We tested students at Carnegie Mellon University using a Wizard of Oz approach. While participants did not hit our age target, we used results to broadly iterate on what was working in our designs. </p>

							<p>Major findings:</p>

							<ul>
								<li>BeepBoop brought interactions with an agent to the table and was overall really fun, likable, and capable of invoking curiosity.</li>
								<li>BeepBoop lacked a distinct function within the playspace. </li>
								<li>In the digital physics game, the virtual agent was able to interact more meaningfully with players.</li>
								<li>In digital physics, the virtual agent functioned more as a teacher or parent rather than a companion.</li>
							</ul>

							<br/><a class="popup-link" href="images/portfolio/virtualAgents/digitalPhysics.jpg"><img src="images/portfolio/virtualAgents/digitalPhysics.jpg"></a><br/>


							<p><strong>Mid-fi prototype</strong></p>

							<p>To improve interactivity between participant and virtual agent, we introduced a new game in our second round of testing: marble run. A mix of a puzzle and golf, marble run directed players to use blocks and ramps to lead a marble from one side of a table to a designated goal. The increased complexity and openness of the game, we hoped, would produce more collaboration between players and the virtual agent, which we named ALEX. We tested ALEX on three planes: virtual agent on screen, virtual agent and proxy, virtual agent as proxy.</p>

							<p>Major findings:</p>

							<ul>
								<li>Perspective matters. Most players dismissed the virtual agent because of its limited physical presence and mainly vocal impact.</li>
								<li>Players move fast. In all of our simulations, it was difficult for the virtual agent to keep up with participants.</li>
								<li>The virtual agent needs to be involved, otherwise participants felt that they were comfortable completing tasks together and ignoring the virtual agent. </li>
							</ul>

							<a href="images/portfolio/virtualAgents/virtual-agents-mid-fi-report.pdf"><p>View the full mid-fidelity report.</p></a>

							<br/><img src="images/portfolio/virtualAgents/mid-fi-conditions.png">

							<p><strong>Hi-fi prototype</strong></p>

							<p>We noted that, given time and experience constraints, it was unlikely we’d be able to test a realistic form of embodiment. Thus, we pivoted to focus our final round of testing on actuation and visualization. We tested across three experimental conditions: Shadow drawing, Shadow Movement, and Controller Movement.</p>

							<p>Marble run received an upgrade in order to necessitate collaboration with the virtual agent - blocks were painted different colors, and we added a rule that players (including the virtual agent) could only move their color blocks. Based on the testing condition, participants had to draw or describe what they wanted to do before a player could comply.</p>

							<p>We performed 6 trials with 10 children between the ages 7 - 13. Trials consisted of an ice breaker, the marble run activity, and a post interview and survey.</p>

							<p>Major findings:</p>

							<ul>
								<li>Building rapport between the virtual agent and participants was important</li>
								<li>Giving the virtual agent a personality made it easier to connect with</li>
								<li>Participants felt like the virtual agent was just another human player </li>
								<li>Kids often assumed the virtual agent was right </li>
							</ul>

							<p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p>

							<p>The ArticuLab will continue to refine and test the work our team began, namely developing a more realistic form of embodiment. We recommend future tests integrate, at least visually, a virtual agent that is representative of the SCIPR vision. Interacting with a real virtual agent versus a human acting as one, we predict, will yield significant results in engagement and willingness to collaborate.</p>

							<div class="desc_header"> <p><hr><strong>Process</strong><hr></p></div>

							<p><strong>Background Research</strong></p>

							<p>Our team targeted transportation due to its recent popularity and growth. We conducted surveys to identify market gaps and opportunities. Evidently, <i>ridesharing</i> was a big topic of conversation. When we asked riders what mattered most to them, <i>cost and convenience dominated</i>. But when asked which ridesharing service they preferred, riders’ answers varied across the board.</p>

							<p>We found that access to ride cost estimates varied by app. This inconvenienced riders who primarily relied on cost as a deciding factor in choosing between ridesharing experiences they felt were comparable.</p>

							<p><strong>Sketch to Wireframe</strong></p>

							<p>I modeled initial wireframes after riders’ desires for cost and convenience. Our mobile solution - dubbed iCommute - aimed to consolidate transportation comparisons in one application.</p>

							<a class="popup-link" href="images/portfolio/icommute/early-prototypes.png"><img src="images/portfolio/icommute/early-prototypes.png"></a>

							<p><strong>User Testing</strong></p>

							<p>Initial user feedback to our wireframes supported the simplistic, one-screen nature of the application. Made for commuters on-the-go, convenience and accessibility were important.</p>

							<p>Some users felt the app might have been too minimalist for first time users, relying on iconography mainly to support user activity. The app itself, we found to be too Uber-Lyft centric. Transportation encompasses many different forms, and we wanted our application to highlight these options. Rather than tell users what was best, we aimed to inform clearly and concisely so commuters could make quick decisions.</p>

							<p><strong>Logo Design</strong></p>

							<p>Part of our redesign involved creating a consistent, identifiable logo conveying a sense of simplicity and the passage of time. My first pass at logo creation, I worked through some attempts in Illustrator.</p>

							<a class="popup-link" href="images/portfolio/icommute/logo-progression.png"><img src="images/portfolio/icommute/logo-progression.png"></a>

							<p><strong>Color Matters</strong></p>

							<p>I tried to choose a color scheme that I thought would be both playful and trustworthy. I also didn't want to reflect color schemes of other popular ridesharing apps, Uber & Lyft. The palette is intentionally limited to allow user's to focus on quickly adding a destination and comparing transporation services.</p>

							<img src="images/portfolio/icommute/color-palette.png">

							<p><strong>UI Revisions</strong></p>

							<p>Our research also showed that users preferred a visual confirmation of input destinations when putting in an address. We addressed this by including a map on the home screen, similar to other ridesharing applications. The new home screen includes an additional visual aid that instructs users to enter where they want to go.</p>

							<p>The “compare” screen no longer emphasizes a result beyond order of results, giving autonomy back to users. By tapping “Commute Details”, we hoped to offer more granularity to users who wish to know more about a service before committing. Users can now prioritize results by features such as cost and total trip time - accessible via the settings menu.</p>

							<p><strong>More To Do</strong></p>

							<p>In the future, we would’ve liked to investigate the results page in order to determine what information is most important to users, in what situations, and how best to present it. </p>

							<p>While the goal of the project itself was to produce a concept, we considered technical feasibility as well. Going forward, we would have liked to build a prototype based on available ridesharing API’s and publicly-accessible data.</p>

As part of its work, ZWPA performs waste audits in order to identify how trash, recycling, and compost can be better disposed of within an organization’s waste infrastructure. 
									</p>

									<p><strong>The Task.</strong> Initially, all of ZWPA's records were handwritten and recorded on a series of paper documents. No formal content organization existed, and ZWPA lacked a way to archive records. Our task was to examine the pain points of this process in order to design and implement a technical solution. Additionally, we considered app extensibility, accessibility, and ease-of-use. Acting as consultants, we adapted our approach based on project developments.
									</p>

								</div>

								<div class="small-12 medium-6 columns">
									<p><strong>My Role.</strong> As design lead on a team of four, I drove efforts to first understand ZWPA’s current process as well as identify how design could be employed to help ZWPA better achieve its goals. I was also involved in the front-end development of the final app.
									</p>

									<p><strong>Constraints.</strong> Our team was challenged to provide a sustainable solution within ZWPA’s technical and financial means. We considered how the current process could best be represented with technology, as well as what was feasible based on budget.
									</p>

									<p><strong>Result.</strong> A deployed web app that integrates with key phases of the ZWPA’s waste audit process. With the ZWPA app, waste auditors can initiate, record, and archive key features of the waste audit process with clients.
									</p>

								</div>

							</div>

							<div class="desc_header"> <p><hr><strong>Process</strong><hr></p></div>
							<p>Our team followed an agile methodology which consisted of weeklong sprints. Following each sprint, we would determine new objectives and where we needed to iterate or work further. </p>

							<p><strong>Research & Data Gathering</strong></p>

							<p>Initially, my team started by creating a workflow and affinity diagram based on ZWPA interviews and observing their workspace. Based on our research, our team chose to address several key issues: </p>
								<ul><i>
								<li>Eliminating ZWPA’s reliance on paper documents.</li>
								<li>Creating an efficient and reliable interface for archiving and documenting audits.</li>
								<li>Taking advantage of ZWPA’s access to tablet technology. </li></i>
							</ul></p>

							<p>Through the implementation of our application, we also aimed to <i>reduce the turnaround time of reports</i> by digitizing the auditing process. By taking a process that normally took weeks to a couple of days, we hoped ZWPA would be able to service more customers longterm.</p>

							<p><strong>Database Design & Ideation</strong></p>

							<p> The most critical points of the process involved creating an initial client account, conducting an initial client questionnaire, and performing an actual waste audit. Given the mobile nature of waste auditing, our team determined it would be best to design a responsive solution. By designing for tablet as well as mobile, we hoped to improve overall project accessibility.</p>

							<p>We began by generating an ERD representative of the current audit process, as well as a revised ERD of an ideal process that would allow ZWPA to expand its current offerings and serve more organizations in the future. This laid the groundwork for our initial sketches and wireframes, which we designed for tablet:</p>

								</div>
							</div>

							<p><strong>Testing & Development</strong></p>

							<p>We met with our clients weekly to conduct user testing based on the most up-to-date wireframes and prototypes. Later in development, our clients performed a test of the new audit system on-site with one of their customers. From their experience, we realized that the layout of the questionnaire portion was “clunky” and hard to navigate. Based on this feedback, we redesigned the questionnaire to be built in logical sections that were visible only if necessary based on previous questions answered. This allowed ZWPA employees to quickly scan items and choose when they wanted more granularity. </p>

							<p>Through feedback incorporated from ZWPA field-testing, we also added image capture functionality as well as the ability to export reports to Excel for our MVP release. While time constraints did not allow the team to create a functional graphing applet, by exporting reports to Excel we were able to alleviate much of the manual work ZWPA members previously had to perform.</p>

							</div>

							<p><strong>Final Results and Documentation</strong></p>

							<p>We were able to deliver the ZWPA waste application after four months of design, development, and iteration. Because ZWPA noted the issue of privacy and security of client information, we built in user authentication. ZWPA is able to retrieve these login credentials on demand through the application if necessary.</p>

							<p>Due to the high turnaround rate of non-profit employees, we found it important to include documentation for the new audit system. The final ZWPA app includes a “Help” feature that details the high-level purpose of the application, the specific areas it fulfills, and how the application tools work. By providing a detailed walkthrough, we hoped to ensure the application’s longevity and continued use by PRC.</p>
							

							<p>Thus, with the ZWPA waste audit app, ZWPA members are able to more efficiently complete audits in the field, as well as access important data from any internet-enabled device be it mobile, tablet, or desktop. While it once took weeks for ZWPA members to organize, compile, and transfer written records to digital form, this process now takes a matter of seconds. At the conclusion of our project, ZWPA noted the added efficiency our solution would provide, as well as how it would improve their own interactions with their customers. </p>

Final deliverables included a customer experience map and business growth model.

							<div class="desc_header"> <p><hr><strong>Process</strong><hr></p></div>

							<p><strong>Part 1: Brainstorming &amp; Idea Validation</strong></p>

							<p>FitMate was conceived on the basis of two broad hypotheses: <i>many people like to exercise</i> + <i>many people would like to exercise with others</i>. To test our hypotheses, each member of the team created a short storyboard. Originally, we envisioned FitMate as appealing to people’s desire to stay healthy and get in shape. We tested this by creating five separate user scenarios and storyboards and asking potential users to walk through them in a ‘speed-dating’ format.</p>

							<div class="row align-center">

								<div class="small-12 columns">

									</div>
								</div>								


							</div>



							<p>We found that, encouragingly, people generally prefer working out with others if given the option. Interestingly, <i>specific forms of exercise appeal to partner or group workouts more than others</i>. Likewise, most respondents reported that they were <i>more inclined to workout with people in their community</i> (friends, classmates, coworkers, etc).</p>

							<p>Based on this feedback, we found that we needed to <i>narrow our focus from all exercises to running</i> - an activity frequently performed in groups. We also pivoted to focus on matching people in <i>similar social groups</i> based on availability. To test FitMate’s appeal to younger audiences, we planned to test a model of FitMate that incorporated <i>gamification</i>, allowing users to challenge their friends to running events and races.</p>

								</div>


							</div>

							<p><strong>Phase 2: Brand & Prototyping</strong></p>

							<p>We explored our concept visually by experimenting with branding. In the end, we narrowed on two contrasting brands - a <i>minimalist</i> approach focused on the challenge aspect of the app, as well as a more <i>traditional</i>, verbose brand evocative of the app’s health benefits. We created two sample landing page variants based on these and used A/B testing to gauge their effectiveness. </p>

										<a class="popup-link" href="images/portfolio/FitMate/logo-collage.jpg"><img src="images/portfolio/FitMate/logo-collage.jpg"></a>
									</div>
									
								</div>								


							</div>

							<p>We created high-fidelity prototypes of FitMate for testing. Our prototypes focused on key concepts such as finding a running buddy as well as gasification. To get a better sense of the successes/failures of our app in practice, we utilized concierge service testing in combination with prototypes. We simulated this in part by recruiting people who had never met and scheduling a time for them to run together.</p>
							
							<div class= "row align-center">

										</div>
										
								</div>
							</div>

							<p>Overall, users were excited by the opportunity to incorporate their <i>friends and members of the community </i>into their app experience, and found the <i>gaming inclusion fun</i>. In our A/B testing, our minimalist brand was favored more by visitors as well, suggesting an emphasis on playfulness.</p>

							<p>Test participants were somewhat skeptical of the concept of meeting complete strangers to workout. To reinforce a feeling of security within FitMate, we pivoted our approach to be based more firmly on finding running partners within a community rather than randomly in an area. </p>

							<p><strong>Part 3: Pitching the App</strong></p>

							<p>We concluded from our findings that FitMate successfully catered to three phases: <i>pre-run</i>, <i>run</i>, and <i>post-run</i>.</p>

							<p>A challenge was encouraging user engagement following a run. In response, we identified an unaddressed use case in <i>organized racing</i>. By leveraging the active running community of FitMate, we envisioned giving users the ability to browse, register for, and challenge friends to participate in upcoming races. This functionality appealed to both our goals of gamification as well as socialization. </p>

								</div>								


							</div>

							<p>Based on feedback that suggested women would be more responsive to group workouts, we adjusted our mockups to appeal more to a female audience. Visually, it was important to convey both friendliness and security, which we attempted by reigning in some of the color choices from our previous prototypes and realigning with a lighter teal. This design we felt gave a softer appearance, less jarring than some of our previous explorations.</p>

							<p>To continue the lean process, we created a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/888350120/2092080571?token=209cc371"> Kickstarter </a> campaign for FitMate and video.</p>

							<p><strong>Playing with Content</strong></p>

							<p>I started by playing with the content in InDesign. I chose to work with the Univers typeface because of its legibility and variety of font weights. My font choice I hoped would be attention-grabbing, but not distracting in poster form.</p> 

							<p>My first iterations experimented with how font size, typographic weight, and other graphical elements affected my composition. From this phase, I obtained a sense of how different visual factors could affect a viewer's perception of the given material.</p>

							</div>

							<p><strong>Color</strong></p>

							<p>I was challenged to devise a color scheme that utilized my least favorite color: a bright orange. In general I utilized a limited color palette, experimenting with an analogous and then complementary color scheme. To maintain my intended simplicity of design, I eventually chose a complementary color scheme for my latter iterations.</p>

							<img src="images/portfolio/poster/original-colors.png"><br/>

							<p><strong>Rough Concepts</strong></p>

							<p>I experimented with a background color in my initial iterations - the theory being that my  design would differentiate itself this way when placed beside other posters. In doing so, I felt I sacrificed too much in the way of information clarity. I also hoped to later reduce the dominance of the guiding line in the design.</p>

							<p>For my next design I focused on distinguishing content from the negative space. Thus, I slightly increased the font size of the event headings, and decreased the stroke of the white, directional line. I also added a complementary blue fill to diversify the background intensity, while also creating the illusion of a skyline.</p>

							</div>

							<p><strong>Diverge and Explore</strong></p>

							<p>My next iterations explored two themes of my previous iterations: <i>minimalism</i> and <i>dimensionality</i>. To augment my new design direction, I updated my color scheme. This time, I based my palette off of a warmer, friendlier orange.</p>

								</div>

							</div>

							<p>Taking my initial concepts to extremes helped highlight different design possibilities, as well as what was working and what was not. I found that negative space could be as attention-directing as color. In my more minimalist exploration, I also noted the power of subtle visual cues in order to draw the eye while limiting distractions. </p>

							<p><strong>Visual Refinement</strong></p>

							<p>I combined concepts from previous explorations for my final design. Ultimately, I chose to utilize negative space rather than a filled background color as I found it to be more effective in drawing attention throughout the text. I also reduced the opacity of repetitive, ‘filler’ text in the header to better emphasize the text around it. </p>

							<p>Tasked with proposing improvements to the current system of scheduling external speakers and guests, my team began by performing observations. Our goal was to understand the AA’s process of scheduling visitors on campus. Our observations included related tasks such as reimbursement and managing travel arrangements.</p>

							<p>Based on our observations, we interpreted our notes into flow and sequence models. We recorded the various roles involved in the scheduling process, as well as noted any breakdowns in the current system. This allowed us to identify the primary players in a typical flow (the AA and visitor) as well as auxiliary interactors (reimbursement department, travel agency, hotel, catering company, AA supervisor).</p>

							<div class="row align-center">
								<div class="small-12 columns">
									<a class="popup-link" href="images/portfolio/high-res/sequence.jpg"><img src="images/portfolio/sequence.jpg"></a>
								</div>
							</div>
							

							<p>To get a better sense of how the responsibilities of these various groups interacted, we then focused our attention on consolidating our notes - observing where there was overlap and where users had similar feedback. We compiled our findings in an affinity diagram and consolidated flow model.</p>

							<div class="row align-center">

								</div>
							</div> 
							<p>Our findings allowed us to identify the key pain points throughout visitor scheduling. We divided these primary procedural breakdowns into two groups: “Pre-Visit” and “Post-Visit”. We found that most of the work done by AA’s occurred within these two phases, and that a successful “Pre-Visit” often resulted in an easier “Post-Visit”. Based on this, we identified three primary goals for our process redesign:</p>

							<ul><i>
								<li>Re-evaluate communication system between the AA and visitor.</li>
								<li>Address difficulties in extracting visitor information for the AA.</li>
								<li>Facilitate use of information & data in the future (i.e. in the post-visit).</li></i>


							</ul>

							<p>Our group iterated through a variety of solutions, using modeling and sketching to brainstorm. We tried to target one breakdown in particular in order to design an <i>elegant</i>, <i>robust solution </i> making use of <i>existing processes and technology</i>. We settled on a design we felt would be most effective in facilitating the pre-visit process as well as future data retrieval.</p>

								<div class="small-12 columns">
									<a class="popup-link" href="images/portfolio/high-res/visions.png"><img src="images/portfolio/visions.jpg"></a>

								</div>

							</div>
							

							<p>Our final solution took advantage of the email correspondence already utilized by AA’s when communicating with prospective visitors. In its proposed form, our system would allow for the AA to send one, unified form to a designated recipient for data gathering purposes.</p>

							<p>The form would allow for entry of all standard information requested by AA’s before a visit (travel arrangements, date of arrival, guests, etc.) while avoiding the back-and-forth commonly observed in order to retrieve such information. Collected data would then be stored in a database, organized by visitor.</p>

							<p>Making use of an accessible database would nullify some of the issues involved in organizing and retrieving information - particularly paper records from past dates. AA’s would be able to easily gather and review information to use in future processes, as well as update incorrect / inconsistent data per request of the visitor.</p>

							<p>We presented our complete findings and vision to other students as well as campus Administrative Assistants. Our vision we represented by sketch:</p>

							<a class="popup-link" href="images/portfolio/high-res/vision_walkthroughhr.png"><img src="images/portfolio/scheduling/vision-walkthrough-prev.jpg"></a><br><br>

							<p>We determined that key impediments to our proposal were cost & time, security, and user training & education. If allowed more time, future iterations of our revitalized system would have had to address these components.</p>
