							<div class="row summary-text">
								<div class="small-12 medium-6 columns">
									<p><strong>My Role.</strong> Collaborating mainly with three other UI designers and researchers, I spearheaded the location page redesign effort from conception to finalization. As part of my role, I conducted initial customer interviews, performed heuristic evaluation, and analyzed page analytics. I was also responsible for ideation, sketching, and wireframing. I worked with other designers and project leaders to establish business rules based on my designs. 
									</p>

								</div>

								<div class="small-12 medium-6 columns">
									<p><strong>Constraints.</strong> I had to ensure that final designs were on-brand and consistent with established patterns. Designs had to be both technically feasible, as well as cognizant of the page owners responsible for maintaining location pages.
									</p>

									<p><strong>Result.</strong> A design pleasing for employees and manageable for each location’s page owners that promoted efficiency and scalability. This included a revised information hierarchy, and the addition of a new room-finding component.
									</p>

								</div>

							</div>
							<div class="desc_header"> <p><hr><strong>Process</strong><hr></p></div>
						
							
							<p>I followed an iterative process that began with user research and concluded with a high-level page template and design specs. I performed daily scrums with my team members to report my progress and discuss revisions and next steps.</p>


							<p><strong>Identifying the Problem</strong></p>
							
							<p>The need for my project was based on research conducted prior to my arrival that showed serious flaws in the intranet IA. Site analytics revealed that this extended to location pages, as <i>60-70% of location page visitors either exited or “browser backed”</i> after visiting a location page. Meant to be a resource, much of the <i>information on location pages had become out-of-date</i>. Moreover, some locations had resorted to creating <i>independent sub-pages</i> of content that reduced consistency.</p>

							<p>My future interviews would eventually reveal other issues including inconsistent and broken links, varying page layouts, and unclear information hierarchy. Issues in design ultimately affected users’ ability to navigate and utilize location pages effectively, thus hampering productivity. </p>

							<p><strong>Research and Evaluation</strong></p>
							<p>I decided to deep dive into some of the intranet issues in a variety of ways. I performed a <i>heuristic evaluation</i> on the current location pages, <i> analyzed page behavior and trends</i>, and conducted <i>customer interviews </i>regarding location page use and awareness. </p>

							<div class="row align-center">
								<div class="small-12 columns">
									<a class="popup-link" href="images/portfolio/Intuit/intuit-interview-quotes.png"><img src="images/portfolio/Intuit/intuit-interview-quotes.png"></a>
								</div>				
							</div>


							
							<p>Research showed that <i>activity is varied</i>, and that location pages are often used as <i>starting points</i> for various other tasks. Tasks vary by department, position, etc., but the most popular areas involve <i>setting agendas</i>, <i>looking up conference rooms</i>, and <i>viewing location maps</i>. Moreover, most <i>tasks are performed simultaneously</i> with other actions.</p>
							

							<div class="row align-center">

									<a class="popup-link" href="images/portfolio/Intuit/team-process.jpg"><img src="images/portfolio/Intuit/team-process.jpg"></a>
								</div>

							</div>

							<p>From initial user feedback, I derived two key personas: <i>the traveler and the organizer</i>.</p>

							<p>I used these two personas to fuel my initial ideation. I hoped to provide a final design that would satisfy both travelers and agenda organizers. I noted the overlap between these groups, namely the need to lookup meeting and conference room information. I aimed to make this information accessible and efficient.</p>

							<p><strong>Sketching and UI Design</strong></p>

							<p>When I began sketching, I developed several design objectives:</p>
							<ul>
								<li><i>Apply a consistent layout</i> for all location sites.</li>
								<li><i>Improve information surfacing and efficiency.</i></li>
								<li><i>Reduce clutter and increase clarity</i> by determining what information was unnecessary.</li>
								<li><i>Make an experience that is scalable</i> and can be applied to both large and small Intuit sites.</li>
								<li><i>Incorporate an element of user “delight”.</i></li>
							</ul>

							<p>Moving from low to high-fidelity mock-ups, I utilized the intranet framework library to ensure consistency in visuals and interactions. Visually, I adopted the modular approach that had been set, and used the Bootstrap 12-column grid to guide my choices in layout.</p>

								</div>

								

							</div>

							<p><strong>Design Refinement</strong></p>


							<p>One of my early decisions was deciding between a three-column or two-column approach. Although most of Insight was designed in two-columns, I felt a three-column modular layout helped differentiate location pages from other content pages. Additionally, my research showed that people used location pages as “portals”, and thus I hoped a change in column structure would reflect the nature of these pages in context. Three columns also allowed more space for growth in the future.</p>

							<p>As one of my final innovations, I also designed the UI for and proposed a conference room-finder component. Research revealed that redirection to conference room details was popular on location pages. I proposed surfacing this information via a dedicated panel that would allow users to search for rooms based on configurations and location. This would eliminate browsing time and streamline information for users booking meetings.</p>

							<p><strong>Design Achievements</strong></p>

							<p>In my final designs, I …</p>

							<ol>
								<li>Streamlined critical information into two categories: For Travelers and On This Campus.</li>
								<li>Improved accessibility of popular features such as room search and amenity browsing.
</li>
								<li>Formed robust content areas that can scale to meet the needs of content providers.</li>
								<li>Added “delight” in the way of a conference room finder.</li>

							 <p><strong>Future Work</strong></p>

							 <p>Because of the time constraints of my internship, my final designs require further iteration and visual design refinement. Additional usability testing would hopefully also be incorporated.</p>

								<div class="small-12 medium-6 columns">
									<p><strong>The Client.</strong> Zero Waste Pennsylvania (ZWPA) is a non-profit seeking to reduce waste generated by organizations throughout Pennsylvania. As part of its work, ZWPA performs waste audits in order to identify how trash, recycling, and compost can be better disposed of within an organization’s waste infrastructure. 
									</p>

									<p><strong>The Task.</strong> Initially, all of ZWPA's records were handwritten and recorded on a series of paper documents. No formal content organization existed, and ZWPA lacked a way to archive records. Our task was to examine the pain points of this process in order to design and implement a technical solution. Additionally, we considered app extensibility, accessibility, and ease-of-use. Acting as consultants, we adapted our approach based on project developments.
									</p>

								</div>

								<div class="small-12 medium-6 columns">
									<p><strong>My Role.</strong> As design lead on a team of four, I drove efforts to first understand ZWPA’s current process as well as identify how design could be employed to help ZWPA better achieve its goals. I was also involved in the front-end development of the final app.
									</p>

									<p><strong>Constraints.</strong> Our team was challenged to provide a sustainable solution within ZWPA’s technical and financial means. We considered how the current process could best be represented with technology, as well as what was feasible based on budget.
									</p>

									<p><strong>Result.</strong> A deployed web app that integrates with key phases of the ZWPA’s waste audit process. With the ZWPA app, waste auditors can initiate, record, and archive key features of the waste audit process with clients.
									</p>

								</div>

							</div>

							<div class="desc_header"> <p><hr><strong>Process</strong><hr></p></div>
							<p>Our team followed an agile methodology which consisted of weeklong sprints. Following each sprint, we would determine new objectives and where we needed to iterate or work further. </p>

							<p><strong>Research & Data Gathering</strong></p>

							<p>Initially, my team started by creating a workflow and affinity diagram based on ZWPA interviews and observing their workspace. Based on our research, our team chose to address several key issues: </p>
								<ul><i>
								<li>Eliminating ZWPA’s reliance on paper documents.</li>
								<li>Creating an efficient and reliable interface for archiving and documenting audits.</li>
								<li>Taking advantage of ZWPA’s access to tablet technology. </li></i>
							</ul></p>

							<p>Through the implementation of our application, we also aimed to <i>reduce the turnaround time of reports</i> by digitizing the auditing process. By taking a process that normally took weeks to a couple of days, we hoped ZWPA would be able to service more customers longterm.</p>

							<p><strong>Database Design & Ideation</strong></p>

							<p> The most critical points of the process involved creating an initial client account, conducting an initial client questionnaire, and performing an actual waste audit. Given the mobile nature of waste auditing, our team determined it would be best to design a responsive solution. By designing for tablet as well as mobile, we hoped to improve overall project accessibility.</p>

							<p>We began by generating an ERD representative of the current audit process, as well as a revised ERD of an ideal process that would allow ZWPA to expand its current offerings and serve more organizations in the future. This laid the groundwork for our initial sketches and wireframes, which we designed for tablet:</p>

									<a class="popup-link" href="images/portfolio/request_show_page1.jpg"><img src="images/portfolio/request_show_page1.jpg"></a>
								</div>
							</div>

							<p><strong>Testing & Development</strong></p>

							<p>We met with our clients weekly to conduct user testing based on the most up-to-date wireframes and prototypes. Later in development, our clients performed a test of the new audit system on-site with one of their customers. From their experience, we realized that the layout of the questionnaire portion was “clunky” and hard to navigate. Based on this feedback, we redesigned the questionnaire to be built in logical sections that were visible only if necessary based on previous questions answered. This allowed ZWPA employees to quickly scan items and choose when they wanted more granularity. </p>

							<p>Through feedback incorporated from ZWPA field-testing, we also added image capture functionality as well as the ability to export reports to Excel for our MVP release. While time constraints did not allow the team to create a functional graphing applet, by exporting reports to Excel we were able to alleviate much of the manual work ZWPA members previously had to perform.</p>

								</div>
							</div>

							<p><strong>Final Results and Documentation</strong></p>

							<p>We were able to deliver the ZWPA waste application after four months of design, development, and iteration. Because ZWPA noted the issue of privacy and security of client information, we built in user authentication. ZWPA is able to retrieve these login credentials on demand through the application if necessary.</p>

							<p>Due to the high turnaround rate of non-profit employees, we found it important to include documentation for the new audit system. The final ZWPA app includes a “Help” feature that details the high-level purpose of the application, the specific areas it fulfills, and how the application tools work. By providing a detailed walkthrough, we hoped to ensure the application’s longevity and continued use by PRC.</p>
							

							<p>Thus, with the ZWPA waste audit app, ZWPA members are able to more efficiently complete audits in the field, as well as access important data from any internet-enabled device be it mobile, tablet, or desktop. While it once took weeks for ZWPA members to organize, compile, and transfer written records to digital form, this process now takes a matter of seconds. At the conclusion of our project, ZWPA noted the added efficiency our solution would provide, as well as how it would improve their own interactions with their customers. </p>

							<div class="desc_header"> <p><hr><strong>Process</strong><hr></p></div>

							<p><strong>Part 1: Brainstorming &amp; Idea Validation</strong></p>

							<p>FitMate was conceived on the basis of two broad hypotheses: <i>many people like to exercise</i> + <i>many people would like to exercise with others</i>. To test our hypotheses, each member of the team created a short storyboard. Originally, we envisioned FitMate as appealing to people’s desire to stay healthy and get in shape. We tested this by creating five separate user scenarios and storyboards and asking potential users to walk through them in a ‘speed-dating’ format.</p>

							<div class="row align-center">

									</div>
								</div>								


							</div>



							<p>We found that, encouragingly, people generally prefer working out with others if given the option. Interestingly, <i>specific forms of exercise appeal to partner or group workouts more than others</i>. Likewise, most respondents reported that they were <i>more inclined to workout with people in their community</i> (friends, classmates, coworkers, etc).</p>

							<p>Based on this feedback, we found that we needed to <i>narrow our focus from all exercises to running</i> - an activity frequently performed in groups. We also pivoted to focus on matching people in <i>similar social groups</i> based on availability. To test FitMate’s appeal to younger audiences, we planned to test a model of FitMate that incorporated <i>gamification</i>, allowing users to challenge their friends to running events and races.</p>

							<p><strong>Phase 2: Brand & Prototyping</strong></p>

							<p>We explored our concept visually by experimenting with branding. In the end, we narrowed on two contrasting brands - a <i>minimalist</i> approach focused on the challenge aspect of the app, as well as a more <i>traditional</i>, verbose brand evocative of the app’s health benefits. We created two sample landing page variants based on these and used A/B testing to gauge their effectiveness. </p>

							<p>We created high-fidelity prototypes of FitMate for testing. Our prototypes focused on key concepts such as finding a running buddy as well as gasification. To get a better sense of the successes/failures of our app in practice, we utilized concierge service testing in combination with prototypes. We simulated this in part by recruiting people who had never met and scheduling a time for them to run together.</p>

							<p>Overall, users were excited by the opportunity to incorporate their <i>friends and members of the community </i>into their app experience, and found the <i>gaming inclusion fun</i>. In our A/B testing, our minimalist brand was favored more by visitors as well, suggesting an emphasis on playfulness.</p>

							<p>Test participants were somewhat skeptical of the concept of meeting complete strangers to workout. To reinforce a feeling of security within FitMate, we pivoted our approach to be based more firmly on finding running partners within a community rather than randomly in an area. </p>

							<p><strong>Part 3: Pitching the App</strong></p>

							<p>We concluded from our findings that FitMate successfully catered to three phases: <i>pre-run</i>, <i>run</i>, and <i>post-run</i>.</p>

							<p>A challenge was encouraging user engagement following a run. In response, we identified an unaddressed use case in <i>organized racing</i>. By leveraging the active running community of FitMate, we envisioned giving users the ability to browse, register for, and challenge friends to participate in upcoming races. This functionality appealed to both our goals of gamification as well as socialization. </p>

							<p>Based on feedback that suggested women would be more responsive to group workouts, we adjusted our mockups to appeal more to a female audience. Visually, it was important to convey both friendliness and security, which we attempted by reigning in some of the color choices from our previous prototypes and realigning with a lighter teal. This design we felt gave a softer appearance, less jarring than some of our previous explorations.</p>

							<p>To continue the lean process, we created a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/888350120/2092080571?token=209cc371"> Kickstarter </a> campaign for FitMate and video.</p>

							<p>Simply, FeedMe allows users to input their craving of choice and browse how others have recently enjoyed similar cravings. Users’ preferences are added to a customizable menu from which new foods or dishes can be added and removed per the preference of the specific user. With a few simple queries, hungry clients can be motivated to create inspired works of culinary art.</p>

							<p>Our goal with this project was to construct a simplified, single-page experience to satisfy a client need. We utilized the Instagram API to draw on recently shared images - ensuring different results and experiences with each new query. To reduce any learning curves, we consolidated all interactions within a single side-bar from which all critical tasks can be performed. From this control center, users can enter new queries, review recommended search terms (for inspiration), and control their menu.</p>

							<p>To demonstrate FeedMe’s user workflow, I used Adobe Photoshop to mockup a potential interface to help guide development:</p>

							<p>Ideally, FeedMe would allow additional functionality in the way of recipes and restaurant reviews. For our initial <a target="_blank" href="http://feedme-pran123.rhcloud.com/">MVP release</a>, however, we limited the functionality of image queries to simply allow redirection to the original Instagram page.</p>

							<p>Tasked with proposing improvements to the current system of scheduling external speakers and guests, my team began by performing observations. Our goal was to understand the AA’s process of scheduling visitors on campus. Our observations included related tasks such as reimbursement and managing travel arrangements.</p>

							<p>Based on our observations, we interpreted our notes into flow and sequence models. We recorded the various roles involved in the scheduling process, as well as noted any breakdowns in the current system. This allowed us to identify the primary players in a typical flow (the AA and visitor) as well as auxiliary interactors (reimbursement department, travel agency, hotel, catering company, AA supervisor).</p>

								<div class="small-12 columns">
									<a class="popup-link" href="images/portfolio/high-res/sequence.jpg"><img src="images/portfolio/sequence.jpg"></a>
								</div>
							</div>
							

							<p>To get a better sense of how the responsibilities of these various groups interacted, we then focused our attention on consolidating our notes - observing where there was overlap and where users had similar feedback. We compiled our findings in an affinity diagram and consolidated flow model.</p>

							<div class="row align-center">

							</div> 
							<p>Our findings allowed us to identify the key pain points throughout visitor scheduling. We divided these primary procedural breakdowns into two groups: “Pre-Visit” and “Post-Visit”. We found that most of the work done by AA’s occurred within these two phases, and that a successful “Pre-Visit” often resulted in an easier “Post-Visit”. Based on this, we identified three primary goals for our process redesign:</p>

							<ul><i>
								<li>Re-evaluate communication system between the AA and visitor.</li>
								<li>Address difficulties in extracting visitor information for the AA.</li>
								<li>Facilitate use of information & data in the future (i.e. in the post-visit).</li></i>


							</ul>

							<p>Our group iterated through a variety of solutions, using modeling and sketching to brainstorm. We tried to target one breakdown in particular in order to design an <i>elegant</i>, <i>robust solution </i> making use of <i>existing processes and technology</i>. We settled on a design we felt would be most effective in facilitating the pre-visit process as well as future data retrieval.</p>
							<div class="row align-center">
								<div class="small-12 columns">
									<a class="popup-link" href="images/portfolio/high-res/visions.png"><img src="images/portfolio/visions.jpg"></a>

								</div>

							</div>
							

							<p>Our final solution took advantage of the email correspondence already utilized by AA’s when communicating with prospective visitors. In its proposed form, our system would allow for the AA to send one, unified form to a designated recipient for data gathering purposes.</p>

							<p>The form would allow for entry of all standard information requested by AA’s before a visit (travel arrangements, date of arrival, guests, etc.) while avoiding the back-and-forth commonly observed in order to retrieve such information. Collected data would then be stored in a database, organized by visitor.</p>

							<p>Making use of an accessible database would nullify some of the issues involved in organizing and retrieving information - particularly paper records from past dates. AA’s would be able to easily gather and review information to use in future processes, as well as update incorrect / inconsistent data per request of the visitor.</p>

							<p>We presented our complete findings and vision to other students as well as campus Administrative Assistants. Our vision we represented by sketch:</p>

							<a class="popup-link" href="images/portfolio/high-res/vision_walkthroughhr.png"><img src="images/portfolio/vision_walkthrough.jpg"></a><br><br>

							<p>We determined that key impediments to our proposal were cost & time, security, and user training & education. If allowed more time, future iterations of our revitalized system would have had to address these components.</p>
